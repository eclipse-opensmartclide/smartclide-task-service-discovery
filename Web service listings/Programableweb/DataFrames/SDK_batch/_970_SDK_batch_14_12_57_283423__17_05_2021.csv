Features and Capabilities:
- Free Fingerprint Verification SDK allows to develop biometric applications that verify a scanned fingerprint against a previously stored fingerprint (1-to-1 matching).
- The SDK is based on the same technology as VeriFinger SDK. The difference is that the VeriFinger SDK is a commercial SDK that offers much more capabilites for software developers.
- Free Fingerprint Verification SDK does not allow to develop applications that read fingerprint images from files or perform fingerprint identification (1-to-many matching).
- The number of stored fingerprint templates is limited to 10 records in the application's database.
- The VeriFinger SDK allows to develop a wide range of biometric applications that identify fingerprints taken from fingerprint scanner or image files against fingerprints stored in a database (1-to-many matching).
