13,"Who said that waiting at the airport should be an atomic bore? Nonsense. As long as you can use a service like WhileWairport, then waiting for your plane is going to be something productive. This service lets you get real-time information about flights and airlines directly on your mobile, and have that shared with all of your contacts on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Which means that if your plane is going to be late, then youâ€™ll be able to let everybody know about such a thing without having to make a single call, or even send a single SMS. A simple social update will do.
And the social scope of this service doesnâ€™t stop at that. No, WhileWairport lets you meet up with people who are in the same airport that you find yourself in. You can look for people who share your same hobbies and interests, and have a much more pleasant wait if your flightâ€™s been delayed.
And WhileWairport is useful for finding people to share taxis with, too. Simply make it clear where it is you are supposed to get to, and if thereâ€™s any matches then the application will instantly let you know as much.
