The library simplifies posting, commenting, loading streams with ready-made templates and photo upload all in one command and allows for powerful data retrieval / publishing and data type representation.
Making the facebook API as easy as social plugins
EFPA was created out of the will of integrating web apps with facebook faster. It is tasks such 'authenticating' that puts off a lot of first time developers. They are forced to use social plugins as a means of having some connection to facebook.
This has meant that while the social ""copy-paste"" plugins have become a viral addition to any web app or website it has left out true communication with the facebook API to the few who could code to a higher degree.
A consistent API
For those in any level of scripting it is a pain when there are changes to the facebook API (REST to Graph and smaller feature changes etc) where code that developers had written had to be re-learnt and reverted to suit changes. With EFPA being an API to the facebook API itself, it means that changes to the facebook API can occur and be updates while the functions and calls remain the same with EFPA.",,,,,http://labs.gurron.com/projects.php?proj=efpa,,,Library,,,
