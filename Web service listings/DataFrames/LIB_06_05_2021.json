The library simplifies posting, commenting, loading streams with ready-made templates and photo upload all in one command and allows for powerful data retrieval \/ publishing and data type representation.\nMaking the facebook API as easy as social plugins\nEFPA was created out of the will of integrating web apps with facebook faster. It is tasks such 'authenticating' that puts off a lot of first time developers. They are forced to use social plugins as a means of having some connection to facebook.\nThis has meant that while the social \"copy-paste\" plugins have become a viral addition to any web app or website it has left out true communication with the facebook API to the few who could code to a higher degree.\nA consistent API\nFor those in any level of scripting it is a pain when there are changes to the facebook API (REST to Graph and smaller feature changes etc) where code that developers had written had to be re-learnt and reverted to suit changes. With EFPA being an API to the facebook API itself, it means that changes to the facebook API can occur and be updates while the functions and calls remain the same with EFPA.","1552":" Strongly-typed, rate-limit aware client library in ActionScript for use in Flex\/Adobe AIR projects.","1553":" Strongly-typed, rate-limited java client library for Dribbble APIs.","1554":" A Ruby library to interface with the IP2Location API.","1555":" A Ruby library to interface with the geoips.com API","1556":" A Ruby library for interfacing with the PhishTank API.","1557":" A Twitter library for Python!\nFeatures:\n+ OAuth support\n+ Up-to-date with Twitter API\n+ Actively under development\n+ Streaming API support\n+ Cache system (memory, file, memcache)\n+ Python 3 branch","1558":" This is the repository for code from various Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) projects, all of which are released under various Open Source licenses.","1559":" PHP client library for the Yahoo Mail OAuth web service","1560":" Open Source PHP Library for accessing the TicketEvolution API.
