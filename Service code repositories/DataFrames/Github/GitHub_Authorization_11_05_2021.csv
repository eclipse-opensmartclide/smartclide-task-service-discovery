7,https://github.com/NAalytics/Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273.git,"RNA vaccines have become a key tool in moving forward through the challenges raised both in the current pandemic and in numerous other public health and medical challenges.  With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations.  Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs.  Standard methods facilitate such sequencing.  In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.  Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has the benefit of allowing any researchers or clinicians using sequencing approaches to rapidly identify such sequences as therapeutic-derived rather than host or infectious in origin.   For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use.  To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.    Although our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA.  Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations.  We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-- so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable.  But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation.   For further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTerer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing.  As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).  From these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly.  This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out.  Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets.  The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference.   RNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243).  In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand.  In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol.  Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%).  Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents the actual dsRNA content in the original material.  This work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.  ProtoAcknowledgements: Thanks to our colleagues for help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Bijoyita Roy).  Figure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine.  Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the RNA.  Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/].  The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.

No external dependency to QCA.     Convenient signals that can be used for easy OAuth authorization process handling.     Access to request objects that will wrap request signing and network access, but still gives possibility for detailed control of the authentication process for easier integration to existing application logic.

Usage  Regardless of your purposes, you always need to start calling the class Initialize function after initializing setup variables. After you are done with the class, always call the Finalize function at the end.  This class supports either OAuth protocol versions 1.0, 1.0a and 2.0. It abstracts the differences between these protocol versions, so the class usage is the same independently of the OAuth version of the server.  The class also provides built-in support to several popular OAuth servers, so you do not have to manually configure all the details to access those servers. Just set the server variable to configure the class to access one of the built-in supported servers.  If you need to access one type of server that is not yet directly supported by the class, you need to configure it explicitly setting the variables: oauth_version, url_parameters, authorization_header, request_token_url, dialog_url, offline_dialog_url, append_state_to_redirect_uri and access_token_url.  Before proceeding to the actual OAuth authorization process, you need to have registered your application with the OAuth server. The registration provides you values to set the variables client_id and client_secret. Some servers also provide an additional value to set the api_key variable.  You also need to set the variables redirect_uri and scope before calling the Process function to make the class perform the necessary interactions with the OAuth server.  The OAuth protocol involves multiple steps that include redirection to the OAuth server. There it asks permission to the current user to grant your application access to APIs on his/her behalf. When there is a redirection, the class will set the exit variable to 1. Then your script should exit immediately without outputting anything.  When the OAuth access token is successfully obtained, the following variables are set by the class with the obtained values: access_token, access_token_secret, access_token_expiry, access_token_type. You may want to store these values to use them later when calling the server APIs.  If there was a problem during OAuth authorization process, check the variable authorization_error to determine the reason.  Once you get the access token, you can call the server APIs using the CallAPI function. Check the access_token_error variable to determine if there was an error when trying to to call the API.  If for some reason the user has revoked the access to your application, you need to ask the user to authorize your application again. First you may need to call the function ResetAccessToken to reset the value of the access token that may be cached in session variables.","php,oauth,oauth-protocol,oauth-access,oauth-server",11
