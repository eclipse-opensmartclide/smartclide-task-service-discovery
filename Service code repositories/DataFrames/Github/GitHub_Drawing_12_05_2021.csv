UBERMAN (CONT\'D)                 Looks like Roxanne\'s in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He\'s dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we\'re all supposed to be                 ""masterminds"" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont\'d)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you\'d think he\'d invent a                 wool sweater that didn\'t itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato\'s eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague\'s staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, ""God                 does not play dice with the world.""                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI & PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein\'s throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let\'s not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci\'s grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne\'s striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn\'t need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you\'ve already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche\',                 you\'ll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you\'ve                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?                                  MASTER MIND                 What about my revenge?                                  ROXANNE                 We can say it was wasting                 everyone\'s time.                                  MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you\'re my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who\'s now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there\'s suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S HYDROFOIL - DAY              The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the       observatory.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft\'s main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What\'s the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City\'s protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can\'t possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can\'t I? I have attained                 control of the Earth\'s most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth\'s atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star\'s power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We\'re now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.                                                MASTER MIND                 Any last words?              Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.                                  UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there\'s no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.              On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage\'s bars in       his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.                                   PLATO (CONT\'D)                 Nine...

Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What\'s going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They\'re equally       befuddled at the hero\'s sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...              Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.                                  UBERMAN                 SON OF A BITCH!!              Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.

Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don\'t know. These bars are                 made of copper, aren\'t they?                                     PLATO                 Four...                                     MASTER MIND                 Yeah, so?              Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.                                  UBERMAN                 You figured out my weakness, damn                 you. I CAN\'T BEND COPPER!

HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.       Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.              One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.

PLATO                 I don\'t think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let\'s not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there\'s something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE\'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn\'t know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci\'s hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow ""U"" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who\'s still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne\'s eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he\'s just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he\'s committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you\'d                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don\'t you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.

We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw       at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.              Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh       maniacally.

Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it\'s head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver\'s wheel.              They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.              SPINNING HEADLINE: ""MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!""              A VICIOUS TORNADO              It\'s heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.              Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and       aims it at approaching windstorm of death.              He presses the button marked ""Tornado Off.""              The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes.

On top of the neon       lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              HAL STEWART (early 30\'s) takes careful aim with his BOWLING       BALL.                                  HAL                 It\'s a sport of honor, focus and                 grace. Honor the ball, focus on the                 pins, release the ball not hard and                 fast, but as if you were releasing                 a baby dove.              He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It\'s a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.              An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth       looks over at him.                                  HAL                 Okay, do something like that - but                 center it more.                                                                 14.                            She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.                                  ATTRACTIVE BLOND                 Tell me how my form looks, honey.              Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson       administration era derriere.                                   HAL                 Oh, it\'s lookin\' good. It\'s lookin\'                 REAL good.              It doesn\'t get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)                 Hal, I want to see you in my                 office!              Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling       him.                                  VINNIE                 Now!              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE\'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who\'s sitting at his desk.                                  VINNIE                 You\'re fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don\'t know where you\'re                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I\'ve got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I\'m looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register\'s open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don\'t                    think you\'ve thought this through.                    If you fire me, who\'s gonna be                    captain of the alley\'s bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don\'t know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that\'s how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I\'m gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.

A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.                                     HAL                 Thank-you!              EXT.

CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY              The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle       of a busy news day.              Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are       SHOUTING.              The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s...um...It\'s good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone\'s cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I\'m ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody\'s face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?              He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in       his mouth.                                   FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It\'s okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT.

(toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank\'s grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There\'s a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that\'s going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you\'d be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I\'m not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he\'s gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It\'s the suits. They think it\'s       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can\'t use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C\'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody\'s       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn\'t use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn\'t mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that\'s great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There\'s a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne\'s expression, as if       she\'s failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn\'t be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she\'s busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I\'ll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he\'s hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.              LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding       a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind\'s new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.                            In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING       BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads ""Reactor -       Don\'t Touch.""              We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting       on a couch watching TELEVISION.                                  REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)                 It\'s been nearly six weeks, and                 still no word on the whereabouts of                 billionaire playboy, and                 philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune                 in at 11:00 as we look into what                 has become Metro City\'s biggest                 mystery.                                  TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)                 We now return to ""The Hero of our                 Hearts: The Uberman story.""              Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.                                  EINSTEIN                 Just robbed the diamond exchange.                                  MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch? I                 know how you love to start                 reactors.                                                                  22.                                                MASTER MIND                 Maybe later.              Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges       glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.              Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can\'t help but notice that                 you\'ve been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I\'ll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It\'s just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You\'ve                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I\'ve achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND\'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City\'s                 champion. I tell you, I\'ve always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I\'ve pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What\'s the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that\'s not                 love, I don\'t know what is. It\'s                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don\'t                 you see? She\'s the one treasure                 that\'s always escaped you.              From Master Mind\'s expression, we see Plato\'s words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can\'t believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it\'s not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It\'s been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn\'t really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne\'s revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what\'s it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who\'s a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne\'s totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I\'m just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man\'s true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law\'s construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I\'m not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator\'s hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she\'s                         talking about)                 Huh?              He\'s a little uncomfortable with the woman\'s public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman\'s grip.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What\'s it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he\'s captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I\'m just a man doing what                 men do. You\'re Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren\'t you?              They\'re suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and ""In Your Eyes"" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It\'s popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You\'re...you\'re.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Yes, it\'s me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.

Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let\'s see: ""My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you\' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I\'m                 alone once again."" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I\'m sorry. I\'m just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I\'m so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me. Can I                 fill you up?                                  ROXANNE                     (captivated)                 ...Yes.

ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she\'s with.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry - this is so surreal!                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I\'m interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I\'m sure you know what                 that\'s like.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS. For example, mine                 is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.                                  ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Did he? Well, we\'re always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK"" (CONT\'D)                 I\'m sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn\'t know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that\'s                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That\'s it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she\'s       heard every word.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I have to go right now, but I\'d                 really like to see you again - if                 that\'s alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can\'t help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'d love that.              INT.

MASTER MIND                 It\'s plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation.

Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.

Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.

PLATO                 Ah...yeah.                                                                34.                            Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick\'s arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anything, Stenwick?                                  STENWICK                     (shaken)                 No. Ah...sir, I didn\'t know this                 was about spiders. I have a pretty                 severe case of arachnophobia.              Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We\'re gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he\'s       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 How `bout now, Stenwick?                 ....Stenwick?              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in       the background.                                   MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don\'t know what I want. What                 do I want?                                                                 35.                            He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no       advice.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn\'t seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone\'s       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That\'s it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?              The lackeys look at each other, they can\'t believe what       they\'re hearing.                                  EINSTEIN                 I was just kidding, sir. In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we\'ll make a new one. Plato,                 bring me the box!              MINUTES LATER              Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small       table.              Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he\'s immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.                                                EINSTEIN                 Where the hell did you get that?                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, I shot him with a power sucking                 gun and had this idea to use this                 to clone a whole army of evil                 Ubermen. I\'m not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right. Man, he was good!                                  DA VINCI                 You want another volunteer, sir?                                  MASTER MIND                 Not another volunteer driven by the                 need for personal gain. Somebody                 else, somebody pure.              Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the       muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with       white lettering that reads: ""Hal Stewart - Metro City\'s       Newest Hero?""

HAL                 Please, please, you\'re embarrassing                 me. I saw someone in need and I                 helped them. What more can we ask                 of ourselves. I ask you, what more?              A smile creeps across the evil one\'s face.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Somebody like him!              EXT.

PLATO                 Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece                 of work. He used to teach bowling                 at Kingpin\'s.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console       as he speaks to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                     (into phone)                 A modest profession to brilliantly                 hide his true heroic nature. I love                 it.              EXT.

PLATO                 - He volunteers at a school for the                 blind.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 He volunteers. He doesn\'t ask for                 any reward for his deeds. The fates                 are shining down on me. This Mr.                 Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.              EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY              From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child       who\'s sitting on a rock. But up close...                                  HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?                 Then pay up, bitch!                                                               38.                                                HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can\'t I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy\'s shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C\'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we\'re all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I\'m lying?                 Now c\'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy\'s face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don\'t run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I\'ve seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It\'s a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar\'s TELEVISION - it\'s a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman\'s benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It\'s you!   You\'re the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn\'t it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I\'ve ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy\'s the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I\'m Holding Out For A Hero\' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT\'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in ""The Grenada."" I\'d rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you\'re on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40\'s, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we\'ll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT\'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT.

Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we\'re sure this won\'t kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He\'ll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It\'s a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal\'s POV the cat\'s face looks like we\'re seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don\'t look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don\'t feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat\'s talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT\'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you\'re just hallucinating. By                  the way, we\'re out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he\'s looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It\'s empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL\'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT\'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Something\'s not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, okay. Let\'s get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he\'s       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal\'s front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a ""KARATE KID"" POSTER on Hal\'s living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Perfect.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it\'s                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal\'s face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (O.S.)                 You know you\'re out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he\'s been resting his head on Pat\'s lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn\'t happening, this                 isn\'t happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it\'s best to                 freak out.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I\'m gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don\'t get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He\'s so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I\'m okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Good, because we\'ve got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That\'s me alright.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We\'re are we going?                                                               49.                                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 To train.              EXT. PAT\'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver\'s seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He\'s hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I\'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They\'re clearly       impressed with Hal\'s show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       ""hello.""                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal\'s chest.                                     ""PAT MORITA""                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 You\'re bulletproof.                                  HAL                 Okay, do you know that for sure?              Pat quickly aims and fires.              Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He\'s weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat\'s CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it\'s John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it\'s Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can\'t believe what he\'s hearing.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (excited)                 I\'d love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It\'s                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.                                  HAL                 Why, where\'re ya going?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I\'ll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How\'s your sandwich?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It\'s quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don\'t think I\'m too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you\'re not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'m not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don\'t know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we\'ve known each other                 for years.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It means you don\'t give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne\'s smile starting to fade.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn\'t of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'ve run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn\'t                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It\'s not       unlike Uberman\'s except for a giant ""T"" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What\'s the ""T"" stand for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What\'s that supposed to mean?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 It\'s from Roman mythology. Zeus\'s                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don\'t think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 It\'s fine, just don\'t slouch. It\'s                 all in the posture.              He grabs Titan\'s shoulders like a proud papa.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They\'re all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER\'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let\'s go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don\'t hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there\'s no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it\'s my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you\'re a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you\'re                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He\'s suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan\'s first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I\'d like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!

Law and                 order is it\'s own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne\'s reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story\'s mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I\'ve been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were ""just trying to do."" Besides,                 I heard you couldn\'t take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You\'re not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We\'ll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I\'m sure there\'s a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank\'s steps. In the corner       of the screen is written: ""recorded earlier.""                                  BRAD HELMS                 For months now, since the death of                 Uberman, the citizens of Metro City                 have been holding out for a hero.                 Well, it appears they won\'t have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated ""The Fab Four Gang."" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?              Brad holds the microphone to Titan\'s face.                                                                59.                                                BRAD HELMS                 I\'m sure all of our viewers are now                 wondering, what\'s the ""T"" stand                 for?                                  TITAN                 It\'s a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is ""Tighten!""              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven\'s sake. I can\'t                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       ""Metro\'s New Hero: Tighten.""                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 We\'ve now fully established Titan                 as Metro City\'s hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato\'s ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn\'t know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don\'t know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don\'t have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He\'s had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That\'s it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I\'m blowing. Who\'s                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I\'m sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I\'m sick of                 working for a super villain who\'s                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci\'s mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You\'re creating super heroes, you                 don\'t go with us on robberies                 anymore, it\'s been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven\'t sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind\'s grip.              Master Mind\'s eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he\'s about to do. He let\'s Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don\'t think I could do                 anything else. It\'s the                 consequences of what we do that I\'m                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 That\'s where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s supposed to.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sounds to me like you\'re running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn\'t for me, he wouldn\'t                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she\'s talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 You can\'t blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he\'d get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                ""JOHN CUSACK""                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 God, no...but don\'t let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it\'s been a long                 time since I -              It\'s starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 I think it\'s starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It\'s been a                 long time since...well, I\'ve been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack\'s disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Oh, no. Don\'t look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that\'s exactly what I\'m                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron\'s are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it\'s his fault. He\'s the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I\'ll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne\'s apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window\'s reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I\'m sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child\'s birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I\'m a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind\'s car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'ll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT\'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don\'t think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell\'s that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it\'s a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what\'s it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 It\'s...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he\'s suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don\'t - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he\'s a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don\'t flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t walk away from me when I\'m                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what\'s going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn\'t just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master\'s agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato\'s eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.

Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I\'ve decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?

A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.

Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 THAT\'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT.

Pat\'s body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat\'s body down and stands respectfully       over him.

Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don\'t have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let\'s get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 How\'s the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let\'s turn it down a few                 notches. It\'s his first time and                 we don\'t want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He\'s certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'ll be here. That\'s the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Unprofessional, that\'s what this                 is. No, it\'s disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It\'s time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL\'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan\'s sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there\'s a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It\'s Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan\'s suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you\'re Master Mind. Yeah!                 You\'re actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We\'re you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that\'s what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There\'s                 nothing to think about. I\'m the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what\'s the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you\'re right. What\'s the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That\'s what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I\'d go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: ""Okay,then                 what?"" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it\'s volunteer                 work. Now you\'ve always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don\'t get caught, which, no                 offense, isn\'t very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I\'m by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain\' and `Brawn\'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 See, you\'d be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I\'ll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I think you\'re probably the biggest                 idiot I\'ve ever met. I mean, I                 can\'t believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You\'re going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind\'s body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver\'s door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind\'s body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It\'s       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don\'t need you, I don\'t need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I\'m                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it\'s time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I\'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How\'d the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It\'s not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don\'t bother about me. I\'m just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what\'s going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don\'t                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard\'s body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager\'s feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT\'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn\'t he?

BRAD HELMS                 ""Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely."" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.

He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy\'s lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don\'t understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there\'s no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I\'m                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won\'t be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman\'s DNA -                 copper. It\'s like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: ""If something works                 don\'t dick with it.""              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I\'m                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender\'s gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That\'s the                 question, isn\'t it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?

TITAN(cont\'d)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what\'s it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that\'s it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it\'s                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can\'t.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 That\'s copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind\'s face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he\'s going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You\'re nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'s not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What\'s funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn\'t think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That\'s it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that\'s my ball!              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building\'s elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne\'s face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It\'s Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That\'s my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It\'s personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn\'t leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not going to like what I\'m                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It\'s chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don\'t                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You\'re talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That\'s pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they\'re just like                 Uberman\'s. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that\'s why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He\'s the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That\'s right, I\'m really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin\'s Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It\'s a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I\'ve                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn\'t ""purposely"" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I\'m going to make something                 that can\'t be taken away from me.                 I\'m going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won\'t be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin\'s.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World\'s                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn\'t have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it\'s pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he\'s nuts. That\'ll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn\'t want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don\'t understand. I have                 certain equipment that\'s - that\'s                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can\'t pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?                                  MASTER MIND                 It creates 100 times the output of                 a nuclear one...If destroyed it                 could...                                  ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!                                  MASTER MIND                     (proudly)                 Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,                 actually. That little baby is                 amazing. I\'m quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we\'d better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C\'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she\'s telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott\'s.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I                 never thought I\'d say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You\'ve only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  A disguise so simple, it\'s                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there\'s nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he\'s       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  I\'ll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                      (to himself)                  What\'s the worst you\'re gonna find?                            (MORE)                                                                  94.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It\'s some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind\'s eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How\'d you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn\'t figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 ""borrowed"" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can\'t do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You\'d just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind\'s head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O) (CONT\'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind\'s hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.                           (MORE)                                                               97.                           WAYNE SCOTT(cont\'d)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn\'t erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It\'s time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind\'s is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can\'t believe it. This whole                 time you\'ve been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don\'t want to hear about it.                 That\'s why I don\'t have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There\'s a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It\'s                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn\'t you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 I know it\'s hard, but you\'ll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn\'t if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you\'ll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind\'s face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 You were a good foe. I\'m sorry if                 I\'ve let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it\'s a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C\'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof\' traps, and I\'d never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn\'t                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs\' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I\'m                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind\'s steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne\'s oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn\'t the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren\'t the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Don\'t you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He\'s holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank\'s loudspeaker\'s,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There\'s a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It\'s nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 That\'s one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You\'re kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I\'ve given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She\'s a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We\'re actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You\'ve been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack       boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hurry, we must be on our way as                 soon as possible.

If he\'s set on destroying us,                 there\'s precious little we could do                 about it.                                  DA VINCI                 Where are we going?                                                              104.

We\'ll start over, we\'ll go back to                 doing what we do best.                                  PLATO                 With our tails between our legs?              The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he\'s not the same man.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, do you have a better plan?!              Master Mind\'s cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his       men and answers it.

ROXANNE                 You\'re running away?                                  MASTER MIND                 In a word - yes.

MASTER MIND                 I didn\'t create this - the god\'s of                 irony did and I am eating the crow                 I so richly deserve.

MASTER MIND                 Will you listen to me, no one can                 stop him.                                   ROXANNE                 You have to try. The city needs                 your help.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m afraid you have an inflated                 opinion of me.                                  ROXANNE                 What the hell\'s happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn\'t have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.                 Please, Roxanne, just come with me.                                  ROXANNE                 No...I guess you are a coward after                 all.              Suddenly, there\'s a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan\'s familiar laugh from his side of       the line.                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne? Roxanne?              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It\'s the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn\'t we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don\'t                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She\'s right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you\'ll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it\'s me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven\'t talked                 in a while, and I\'m sorry. It\'s                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting\'s menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I\'ve tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I\'m about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I\'m going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you\'ll look down at what I\'m about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting\'s stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.

TITAN                 You\'re right. I don\'t HAVE to do                 anything. Isn\'t that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here\'s one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it\'s wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses ""body English"" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It\'s nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan\'s smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don\'t.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter ""M"" is etched in the       web\'s center.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it\'s speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what\'s that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere\'s path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C\'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C\'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He\'s furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT\'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he\'s falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT\'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He\'s a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND\'s CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan\'s EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn\'t emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don\'t mind, I\'m going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything\'s still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I\'m alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It\'s Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman\'s alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We\'re saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City\'s newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I\'m meant to be this                 city\'s savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He\'s like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What\'s the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don\'t know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind\'s hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He\'s       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They\'re cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How\'s it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s a...it\'s nice, you know? I                 usually don\'t get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don\'t know won\'t hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You\'re the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don\'t think I\'d go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title ""Eye on Metro City.""              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who\'s bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City\'s Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind\'s metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what\'s happening, he quickly lets the mayor\'s hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     We\'re okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan\'s cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we\'ve taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there\'s                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They\'re gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don\'t think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It\'s Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It\'s not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I\'m gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you\'re really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it\'s       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we\'re new at this.                                                THE END",,25

The Android app allows you to capture and collect, with various options, the datas about user's current location. The app can also show the map with the routes created with the points stored in the remote database. The app is designed to work offline: after the user has logged in, the app can collect the data in a local database (SQLite); when the device goes back online, all caches in the local database will be sent to the remote database through the RESTful webservices. The communication between the app and the webservices is done with messages formatted according to the JSON standard. The app has several working modes and can manage multiple users: when the app is started for the first time, a screen allows the user to log in to the service or sign up using an other screen. After logged in, the app runs with default preferences that the user can change.  Options are divided into three groups: -\tTracking: o\tEnable tracking o\tPosition acquisition rate -\tNetwork: o\tAutomatic map update  o\tOutput data-rate (to the server) o\tShow the route of the last xx minutes/hours (customizable) -\tMap: o\tRoute drawing mode (driving, walking, free). o\tDefault zoom level o\tMap Mode (Map, Earth, Hybrid) o\tTracking color The app has also a Service that runs in background; it sends the data to the server and collects the data about the current location.""}",,18

He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as       people happily go about their day.              Yet, we can\'t help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman\'s       expression.                                                                2.                                                UBERMAN                 You look so peaceful from up here.              His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND       coming from his wrist.              He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.       It\'s a silver band with a FLASHING red letter ""U"".                                  UBERMAN (CONT\'D)                 Looks like Roxanne\'s in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He\'s dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we\'re all supposed to be                 ""masterminds"" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont\'d)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you\'d think he\'d invent a                 wool sweater that didn\'t itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato\'s eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague\'s staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, ""God                 does not play dice with the world.""                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI & PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein\'s throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let\'s not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci\'s grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne\'s striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn\'t need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you\'ve already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche\',                 you\'ll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you\'ve                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?                                  MASTER MIND                 What about my revenge?                                  ROXANNE                 We can say it was wasting                 everyone\'s time.                                  MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you\'re my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who\'s now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there\'s suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT.

HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft\'s main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What\'s the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City\'s protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can\'t possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can\'t I? I have attained                 control of the Earth\'s most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth\'s atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star\'s power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We\'re now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.

UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there\'s no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.

Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What\'s going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They\'re equally       befuddled at the hero\'s sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...

Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.

Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don\'t know.

One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.                            All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and       smoke.                                  PLATO                 I don\'t think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let\'s not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there\'s something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE\'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn\'t know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci\'s hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow ""U"" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who\'s still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne\'s eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he\'s just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he\'s committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you\'d                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don\'t you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.

We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw       at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.              Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh       maniacally.

Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it\'s head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver\'s wheel.              They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.              SPINNING HEADLINE: ""MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!""              A VICIOUS TORNADO              It\'s heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.              Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and       aims it at approaching windstorm of death.              He presses the button marked ""Tornado Off.""              The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes.

On top of the neon       lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              HAL STEWART (early 30\'s) takes careful aim with his BOWLING       BALL.                                  HAL                 It\'s a sport of honor, focus and                 grace. Honor the ball, focus on the                 pins, release the ball not hard and                 fast, but as if you were releasing                 a baby dove.              He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It\'s a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.              An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth       looks over at him.                                  HAL                 Okay, do something like that - but                 center it more.                                                                 14.                            She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.                                  ATTRACTIVE BLOND                 Tell me how my form looks, honey.              Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson       administration era derriere.                                   HAL                 Oh, it\'s lookin\' good. It\'s lookin\'                 REAL good.              It doesn\'t get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)                 Hal, I want to see you in my                 office!              Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling       him.                                  VINNIE                 Now!              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE\'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who\'s sitting at his desk.                                  VINNIE                 You\'re fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don\'t know where you\'re                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I\'ve got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I\'m looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register\'s open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don\'t                    think you\'ve thought this through.                    If you fire me, who\'s gonna be                    captain of the alley\'s bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don\'t know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that\'s how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I\'m gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.

A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.                                     HAL                 Thank-you!              EXT.

CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY              The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle       of a busy news day.              Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are       SHOUTING.              The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s...um...It\'s good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone\'s cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I\'m ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody\'s face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?              He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in       his mouth.                                   FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It\'s okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT.

ROXANNE                 Frank, listen. I want to go back to                 work. I NEED to go back to work.                                  FRANK                 ...You\'re hysterical, aren\'t you?              Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM       EMBRACE.                                  ROXANNE                 What\'re you doing?                                  FRANK                 Keeping you warm before you go into                 shock.                     (toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank\'s grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There\'s a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that\'s going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you\'d be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I\'m not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he\'s gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It\'s the suits. They think it\'s       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can\'t use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C\'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody\'s       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn\'t use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn\'t mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that\'s great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There\'s a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne\'s expression, as if       she\'s failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn\'t be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she\'s busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I\'ll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he\'s hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.              LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding       a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind\'s new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.                            In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING       BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads ""Reactor -       Don\'t Touch.""              We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting       on a couch watching TELEVISION.                                  REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)                 It\'s been nearly six weeks, and                 still no word on the whereabouts of                 billionaire playboy, and                 philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune                 in at 11:00 as we look into what                 has become Metro City\'s biggest                 mystery.                                  TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)                 We now return to ""The Hero of our                 Hearts: The Uberman story.""              Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.                                  EINSTEIN                 Just robbed the diamond exchange.                                  MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch? I                 know how you love to start                 reactors.                                                                  22.                                                MASTER MIND                 Maybe later.              Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges       glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.              Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can\'t help but notice that                 you\'ve been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I\'ll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It\'s just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You\'ve                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I\'ve achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND\'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City\'s                 champion. I tell you, I\'ve always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I\'ve pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What\'s the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that\'s not                 love, I don\'t know what is. It\'s                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don\'t                 you see? She\'s the one treasure                 that\'s always escaped you.              From Master Mind\'s expression, we see Plato\'s words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can\'t believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it\'s not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It\'s been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn\'t really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne\'s revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what\'s it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who\'s a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne\'s totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I\'m just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man\'s true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law\'s construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I\'m not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator\'s hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she\'s                         talking about)                 Huh?              He\'s a little uncomfortable with the woman\'s public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman\'s grip.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What\'s it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he\'s captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I\'m just a man doing what                 men do. You\'re Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren\'t you?              They\'re suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and ""In Your Eyes"" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It\'s popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You\'re...you\'re.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Yes, it\'s me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.

Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let\'s see: ""My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you\' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I\'m                 alone once again."" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I\'m sorry. I\'m just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I\'m so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me. Can I                 fill you up?                                  ROXANNE                     (captivated)                 ...Yes.                     (catching herself)                 I mean, excuse me?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Can I fill you up? Your coffee.                                  ROXANNE                 Right.              INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE\' - LATER              Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word       intently.                                  ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she\'s with.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry - this is so surreal!                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I\'m interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I\'m sure you know what                 that\'s like.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS. For example, mine                 is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.                                  ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Did he? Well, we\'re always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK"" (CONT\'D)                 I\'m sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn\'t know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that\'s                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That\'s it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she\'s       heard every word.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I have to go right now, but I\'d                 really like to see you again - if                 that\'s alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can\'t help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'d love that.              INT.

MASTER MIND                 It\'s plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation. Without                 that stimulus they wither and die.                 Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.

Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.

MASTER MIND                 And this one?                                  PLATO                 We attached gills to him. He can                 breath under water.                                  MASTER MIND                 Ah. Does he have extraordinary                 strength?                                     PLATO                 Well...no.                                  MASTER MIND                 Can he fly?                                     PLATO                 No.                                  MASTER MIND                 Resilient to weapons fire?                                     PLATO                 No.                                  MASTER MIND                 He just breathes under water, then.                                     PLATO                 Ah...yeah.                                                                34.                            Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick\'s arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anything, Stenwick?                                  STENWICK                     (shaken)                 No. Ah...sir, I didn\'t know this                 was about spiders. I have a pretty                 severe case of arachnophobia.              Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We\'re gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he\'s       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 How `bout now, Stenwick?                 ....Stenwick?              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in       the background.                                   MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don\'t know what I want. What                 do I want?                                                                 35.                            He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no       advice.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn\'t seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone\'s       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That\'s it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?              The lackeys look at each other, they can\'t believe what       they\'re hearing.                                  EINSTEIN                 I was just kidding, sir. In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we\'ll make a new one. Plato,                 bring me the box!              MINUTES LATER              Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small       table.              Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he\'s immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.                                                EINSTEIN                 Where the hell did you get that?                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, I shot him with a power sucking                 gun and had this idea to use this                 to clone a whole army of evil                 Ubermen. I\'m not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right. Man, he was good!                                  DA VINCI                 You want another volunteer, sir?                                  MASTER MIND                 Not another volunteer driven by the                 need for personal gain. Somebody                 else, somebody pure.              Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the       muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with       white lettering that reads: ""Hal Stewart - Metro City\'s       Newest Hero?""                                  NEWS REPORTER                 ...who risked his own life to save                 that of a young mother and her                 child.                                  HAL                 Please, please, you\'re embarrassing                 me. I saw someone in need and I                 helped them. What more can we ask                 of ourselves. I ask you, what more?              A smile creeps across the evil one\'s face.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Somebody like him!              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of       binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone.                                                               37.                                                PLATO                 Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece                 of work. He used to teach bowling                 at Kingpin\'s.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console       as he speaks to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                     (into phone)                 A modest profession to brilliantly                 hide his true heroic nature. I love                 it.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                  PLATO                 Then you are absolutely going to                 love this -              We follow Plato\'s line of sight across the street where we       see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.                                  PLATO                 - He volunteers at a school for the                 blind.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 He volunteers. He doesn\'t ask for                 any reward for his deeds. The fates                 are shining down on me. This Mr.                 Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.              EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY              From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child       who\'s sitting on a rock. But up close...                                  HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?                 Then pay up, bitch!                                                               38.                                                HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can\'t I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy\'s shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C\'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we\'re all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I\'m lying?                 Now c\'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy\'s face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don\'t run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I\'ve seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It\'s a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar\'s TELEVISION - it\'s a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman\'s benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It\'s you!   You\'re the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn\'t it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I\'ve ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy\'s the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I\'m Holding Out For A Hero\' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT\'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in ""The Grenada."" I\'d rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you\'re on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40\'s, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we\'ll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT\'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS              In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.                                  HAL                 I guess that looks kinda bad.              Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we\'re sure this won\'t kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He\'ll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It\'s a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal\'s POV the cat\'s face looks like we\'re seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don\'t look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don\'t feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat\'s talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT\'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you\'re just hallucinating. By                  the way, we\'re out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he\'s looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It\'s empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL\'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT\'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Something\'s not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, okay. Let\'s get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he\'s       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal\'s front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a ""KARATE KID"" POSTER on Hal\'s living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Perfect.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it\'s                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal\'s face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (O.S.)                 You know you\'re out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he\'s been resting his head on Pat\'s lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn\'t happening, this                 isn\'t happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it\'s best to                 freak out.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I\'m gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don\'t get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He\'s so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I\'m okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Good, because we\'ve got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That\'s me alright.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We\'re are we going?                                                               49.                                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 To train.              EXT. PAT\'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver\'s seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He\'s hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I\'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They\'re clearly       impressed with Hal\'s show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       ""hello.""                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal\'s chest.                                     ""PAT MORITA""                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.

Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He\'s weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat\'s CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it\'s John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it\'s Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can\'t believe what he\'s hearing.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (excited)                 I\'d love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It\'s                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.

""PAT MORITA""                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I\'ll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How\'s your sandwich?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It\'s quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don\'t think I\'m too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you\'re not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'m not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don\'t know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we\'ve known each other                 for years.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It means you don\'t give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne\'s smile starting to fade.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn\'t of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'ve run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn\'t                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It\'s not       unlike Uberman\'s except for a giant ""T"" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What\'s the ""T"" stand for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What\'s that supposed to mean?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 It\'s from Roman mythology. Zeus\'s                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don\'t think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 It\'s fine, just don\'t slouch. It\'s                 all in the posture.              He grabs Titan\'s shoulders like a proud papa.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They\'re all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER\'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let\'s go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don\'t hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there\'s no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it\'s my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you\'re a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you\'re                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He\'s suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan\'s first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I\'d like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!              Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                     (unenthusiastically)                 I...can\'t except this. Law and                 order is it\'s own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne\'s reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story\'s mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I\'ve been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were ""just trying to do."" Besides,                 I heard you couldn\'t take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You\'re not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We\'ll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I\'m sure there\'s a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank\'s steps. In the corner       of the screen is written: ""recorded earlier.""                                  BRAD HELMS                 For months now, since the death of                 Uberman, the citizens of Metro City                 have been holding out for a hero.                 Well, it appears they won\'t have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated ""The Fab Four Gang."" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?              Brad holds the microphone to Titan\'s face.                                                                59.                                                BRAD HELMS                 I\'m sure all of our viewers are now                 wondering, what\'s the ""T"" stand                 for?                                  TITAN                 It\'s a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is ""Tighten!""              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven\'s sake. I can\'t                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       ""Metro\'s New Hero: Tighten.""                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 We\'ve now fully established Titan                 as Metro City\'s hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato\'s ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn\'t know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don\'t know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don\'t have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He\'s had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That\'s it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I\'m blowing. Who\'s                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I\'m sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I\'m sick of                 working for a super villain who\'s                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci\'s mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You\'re creating super heroes, you                 don\'t go with us on robberies                 anymore, it\'s been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven\'t sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind\'s grip.              Master Mind\'s eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he\'s about to do. He let\'s Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don\'t think I could do                 anything else. It\'s the                 consequences of what we do that I\'m                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 That\'s where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s supposed to.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sounds to me like you\'re running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn\'t for me, he wouldn\'t                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she\'s talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 You can\'t blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he\'d get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                ""JOHN CUSACK""                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 God, no...but don\'t let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it\'s been a long                 time since I -              It\'s starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 I think it\'s starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It\'s been a                 long time since...well, I\'ve been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack\'s disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Oh, no. Don\'t look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that\'s exactly what I\'m                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron\'s are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it\'s his fault. He\'s the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I\'ll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne\'s apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window\'s reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I\'m sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child\'s birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I\'m a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind\'s car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'ll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT\'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don\'t think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell\'s that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it\'s a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what\'s it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 It\'s...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he\'s suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don\'t - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he\'s a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don\'t flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t walk away from me when I\'m                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what\'s going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn\'t just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master\'s agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato\'s eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.

Master Mind tightens his grip.                                    MASTER MIND                 Go on.                                  PLATO                 ...distracted.              Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I\'ve decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, we\'ve created our hero, now                 it\'s time to give him a little                 motivation.                                  DA VINCI                 How do we do that?                                  MASTER MIND                 To be simply good is not enough. A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.

SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY              Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,       between buildings, etc. He\'s not really working, just       enjoying himself.                                                                  71.                            INT. WOMAN\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but       her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 THAT\'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT. HAL\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.       Reporters stand just beyond the police line.                                    TITAN                 Crap.              From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.                                    TITAN (CONT\'D)                 PAT!

""PAT MORITA""                 I\'m dying, kid. There is just one                 last lesson I have for you. It is                 the most important of all.                                                                 72.                                                TITAN                 What\'s that?                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Master Mind did this, you must                 avenge me.                                  TITAN                 Master Mind? Why?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Because he\'s evil. You must stop                 the evil Hal - stop the...              Pat\'s body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat\'s body down and stands respectfully       over him. The reporters rush over.                                  REPORTER 1                 Tighten, Is this the work of Master                 Mind?                                  REPORTER 2                 How will the death of your mentor                 affect your resolve?                                  REPORTER 3                 Was that Pat Morita?              Titan walks up to one of the cameras.                                  TITAN                 This injustice will not go                 unpunished. Master Mind, if you can                 hear me, Tighten is coming for you.              In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS       PARAMEDICS, load pat\'s body onto a stretcher.              PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick       it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing       dead.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal\'s       revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don\'t have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let\'s get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 How\'s the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let\'s turn it down a few                 notches. It\'s his first time and                 we don\'t want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He\'s certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'ll be here. That\'s the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Unprofessional, that\'s what this                 is. No, it\'s disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It\'s time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL\'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan\'s sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there\'s a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It\'s Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan\'s suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you\'re Master Mind. Yeah!                 You\'re actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We\'re you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that\'s what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There\'s                 nothing to think about. I\'m the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what\'s the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you\'re right. What\'s the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That\'s what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I\'d go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: ""Okay,then                 what?"" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it\'s volunteer                 work. Now you\'ve always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don\'t get caught, which, no                 offense, isn\'t very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I\'m by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain\' and `Brawn\'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 See, you\'d be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I\'ll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I think you\'re probably the biggest                 idiot I\'ve ever met. I mean, I                 can\'t believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You\'re going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind\'s body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver\'s door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind\'s body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It\'s       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don\'t need you, I don\'t need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I\'m                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it\'s time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I\'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How\'d the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It\'s not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don\'t bother about me. I\'m just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what\'s going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don\'t                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard\'s body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager\'s feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT\'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn\'t he?

Brad Helms wipes into       view.                                                               81.                                                BRAD HELMS                 ""Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely."" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.                                                        CUT TO:              TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE              EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY              Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy\'s lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don\'t understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there\'s no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I\'m                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won\'t be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman\'s DNA -                 copper. It\'s like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: ""If something works                 don\'t dick with it.""              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I\'m                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender\'s gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That\'s the                 question, isn\'t it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?                           (MORE)                                                                 83.                           TITAN(cont\'d)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what\'s it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that\'s it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it\'s                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can\'t.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 That\'s copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind\'s face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he\'s going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You\'re nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'s not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What\'s funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn\'t think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That\'s it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that\'s my ball!              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building\'s elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne\'s face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It\'s Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That\'s my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It\'s personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn\'t leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not going to like what I\'m                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It\'s chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don\'t                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You\'re talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That\'s pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they\'re just like                 Uberman\'s. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that\'s why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He\'s the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That\'s right, I\'m really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin\'s Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It\'s a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I\'ve                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn\'t ""purposely"" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I\'m going to make something                 that can\'t be taken away from me.                 I\'m going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won\'t be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin\'s.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World\'s                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn\'t have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it\'s pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he\'s nuts. That\'ll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn\'t want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don\'t understand. I have                 certain equipment that\'s - that\'s                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can\'t pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?                                  MASTER MIND                 It creates 100 times the output of                 a nuclear one...If destroyed it                 could...                                  ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!                                  MASTER MIND                     (proudly)                 Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,                 actually. That little baby is                 amazing. I\'m quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we\'d better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C\'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she\'s telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott\'s.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I                 never thought I\'d say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You\'ve only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  A disguise so simple, it\'s                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there\'s nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he\'s       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  I\'ll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                      (to himself)                  What\'s the worst you\'re gonna find?                            (MORE)                                                                  94.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It\'s some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind\'s eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How\'d you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn\'t figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 ""borrowed"" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can\'t do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You\'d just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind\'s head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O) (CONT\'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind\'s hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.                           (MORE)                                                               97.                           WAYNE SCOTT(cont\'d)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn\'t erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It\'s time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind\'s is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can\'t believe it. This whole                 time you\'ve been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don\'t want to hear about it.                 That\'s why I don\'t have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There\'s a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It\'s                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn\'t you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 I know it\'s hard, but you\'ll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn\'t if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you\'ll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind\'s face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 You were a good foe. I\'m sorry if                 I\'ve let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it\'s a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C\'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof\' traps, and I\'d never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn\'t                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs\' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I\'m                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind\'s steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne\'s oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn\'t the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren\'t the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Don\'t you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He\'s holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank\'s loudspeaker\'s,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There\'s a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It\'s nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 That\'s one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You\'re kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I\'ve given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She\'s a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We\'re actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You\'ve been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack       boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hurry, we must be on our way as                 soon as possible.

If he\'s set on destroying us,                 there\'s precious little we could do                 about it.                                  DA VINCI                 Where are we going?                                                              104.

We\'ll start over, we\'ll go back to                 doing what we do best.                                  PLATO                 With our tails between our legs?              The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he\'s not the same man.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, do you have a better plan?!              Master Mind\'s cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his       men and answers it.

ROXANNE                 What are you going to do about                 Tighten?              INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.

ROXANNE                 You\'re running away?                                  MASTER MIND                 In a word - yes.                                  ROXANNE                 You created this monster...                                  MASTER MIND                 I didn\'t create this - the god\'s of                 irony did and I am eating the crow                 I so richly deserve.                                  ROXANNE                 There\'s no time for self pity.                                                              105.

You\'ll be                 safe.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m not going anywhere.                                  MASTER MIND                 Will you listen to me, no one can                 stop him.                                   ROXANNE                 You have to try. The city needs                 your help.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m afraid you have an inflated                 opinion of me.                                  ROXANNE                 What the hell\'s happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn\'t have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.                 Please, Roxanne, just come with me.                                  ROXANNE                 No...I guess you are a coward after                 all.              Suddenly, there\'s a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan\'s familiar laugh from his side of       the line.                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne? Roxanne?              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It\'s the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn\'t we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don\'t                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She\'s right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you\'ll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it\'s me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven\'t talked                 in a while, and I\'m sorry. It\'s                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting\'s menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I\'ve tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I\'m about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I\'m going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you\'ll look down at what I\'m about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting\'s stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.

ROXANNE                 I\'m here with the cause of the                 destruction in Metro City. He has                 kidnapped me and a cameraman to                 chronicle what he refers to as the                 creation of a monument to his                 invincibility and overall                 ""Asskickiness.""

Titan suddenly steps into the shot.                                  TITAN                 And I\'m going for the biggest                 strike ever.              He leans into the camera.                                  TITAN                 And you, Metro City, have a                 ringside seat as I cement my name                 in the anal of history.

TITAN(cont\'d)                 One might click there heels and say                 ""There\'s no place like home"" upon                 finding themselves in such a                 fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much                 at home right were he is - with a                 ball in hand and glory in his                 sights.              INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS              In the bowels of Master Mind\'s hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR       glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.                                  ROXANNE                 Hal, I know everyone treated you                 like shit, but you don\'t have to do                 this.                                  TITAN                 You\'re right. I don\'t HAVE to do                 anything. Isn\'t that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here\'s one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it\'s wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses ""body English"" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It\'s nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan\'s smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don\'t.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter ""M"" is etched in the       web\'s center.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it\'s speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what\'s that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere\'s path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C\'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C\'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He\'s furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT\'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he\'s falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT\'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He\'s a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND\'s CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan\'s EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn\'t emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don\'t mind, I\'m going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything\'s still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I\'m alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It\'s Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman\'s alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We\'re saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City\'s newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I\'m meant to be this                 city\'s savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He\'s like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What\'s the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don\'t know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind\'s hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He\'s       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They\'re cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How\'s it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s a...it\'s nice, you know? I                 usually don\'t get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don\'t know won\'t hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You\'re the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don\'t think I\'d go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title ""Eye on Metro City.""              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who\'s bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City\'s Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind\'s metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what\'s happening, he quickly lets the mayor\'s hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     We\'re okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan\'s cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we\'ve taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there\'s                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They\'re gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don\'t think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It\'s Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It\'s not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I\'m gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you\'re really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it\'s       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we\'re new at this.                                                THE END",,25

The Android app allows you to capture and collect, with various options, the datas about user's current location. The app can also show the map with the routes created with the points stored in the remote database. The app is designed to work offline: after the user has logged in, the app can collect the data in a local database (SQLite); when the device goes back online, all caches in the local database will be sent to the remote database through the RESTful webservices. The communication between the app and the webservices is done with messages formatted according to the JSON standard. The app has several working modes and can manage multiple users: when the app is started for the first time, a screen allows the user to log in to the service or sign up using an other screen. After logged in, the app runs with default preferences that the user can change.  Options are divided into three groups: -\tTracking: o\tEnable tracking o\tPosition acquisition rate -\tNetwork: o\tAutomatic map update  o\tOutput data-rate (to the server) o\tShow the route of the last xx minutes/hours (customizable) -\tMap: o\tRoute drawing mode (driving, walking, free). o\tDefault zoom level o\tMap Mode (Map, Earth, Hybrid) o\tTracking color The app has also a Service that runs in background; it sends the data to the server and collects the data about the current location.""}",,18
