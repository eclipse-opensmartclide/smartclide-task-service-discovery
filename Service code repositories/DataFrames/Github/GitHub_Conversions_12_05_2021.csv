Rotating polygons, and Making Java Executable.  Model View Controller (MVC) The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. The View is the interface. The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.  DESIGN PATTERNS:  Strategy design patternis used if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses.  The Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject (Publisher), maintains a list of its dependents, called observers (Subscribers), and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.  The Factory design pattern is used when you want to define the class of an object at runtime. It also allows you to encapsulate object creation so that you can keep all object creation code in one place  The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated.  The Singleton pattern is used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object. (Scrabble letters app)  The Builder Design Pattern is used when you want to have many classes help in the creation of an object. By having different classes build the object you can then easily create many different types of objects without being forced to rewrite code. The Builder pattern provides a different way to make complex objects like you'd make using the Abstract Factory design pattern.  The Prototype design pattern is used for creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects. It allows for the adding of any subclass instance of a known super class at run time. It is used when there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime. The major benefit of using the Prototype pattern is that it reduces the need for creating potentially unneeded subclasses.  Java Reflection is an API and it's used to manipulate classes and everything in a class including fields, methods, constructors, private data, etc. (TestingReflection.java)  The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically. You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time. It is more flexible than inheritance. The Decorator Design Pattern simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes. Also, rather than rewrite old code you can extend it with new code and that is always good. (Pizza app)  The Command design pattern allows you to store a list of commands for later use. With it you can store multiple commands in a class to use over and over. (ElectronicDevice app)  The Adapter pattern is used when you want to translate one interface of a class into another interface. Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together. It allows the use of the available interface and the target interface. Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface. (EnemyAttacker app)   The Facade pattern basically says that you should simplify your methods so that much of what is done is in the background. In technical terms you should decouple the client from the sub components needed to perform an operation. (Bank app)  The Bridge Pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Progressively adding functionality while separating out major differences using abstract classes. (EntertainmentDevice app)  In a Template Method pattern, you define a method (algorithm) in an abstract class. It contains both abstract methods and non-abstract methods. The subclasses that extend this abstract class then override those methods that don't make sense for them to use in the default way. (Sandwich app)  The Iterator pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of Objects. You can also write polymorphic code because you can refer to each collection of objects because they'll implement the same interface. (SongIterator app)  The Composite design pattern is used to structure data into its individual parts as well as represent the inner workings of every part of a larger object. The composite pattern also allows you to treat both groups of parts in the same way as you treat the parts polymorphically. You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole object individually. (SongComponent app)  The flyweight design pattern is used to dramatically increase the speed of your code when you are using many similar objects. To reduce memory usage the flyweight design pattern shares Objects that are the same rather than creating new ones. (FlyWeightTest app)  State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. (ATMState)  The Proxy design pattern limits access to just the methods you want made accessible in another class. It can be used for security reasons, because an Object is intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location. You can think of it as a gate keeper that blocks access to another Object. (TestATMMachine)  The Chain of Responsibility pattern has a group of objects that are expected to between them be able to solve a problem. If the first Object can't solve it, it passes the data to the next Object in the chain. (TestCalcChain)  The Interpreter pattern is used to convert one representation of data into another. The context cantains the information that will be interpreted. The expression is an abstract class that defines all the methods needed to perform the different conversions. The terminal or concrete expressions provide specific conversions on different types of data. (MeasurementConversion)  The Mediator design pattern is used to handle communication between related objects (Colleagues). All communication is handled by a Mediator Object and the Colleagues don't need to know anything about each other to work together. (TestStockMediator)  The Memento design pattern provides a way to store previous states of an Object easily. It has 3 main classes: 1) Memento: The basic object that is stored in different states.  2) Originator: Sets and Gets values from the currently targeted Memento. Creates new Mementos and assigns current values to them.  3) Caretaker: Holds an ArrayList that contains all previous versions of the Memento. It can store and retrieve stored Mementos. (TestMemento)  The Visitor design pattern allows you to add methods to classes of different types without much altering to those classes. You can make completely different methods depending on the class used with this pattern. (VisitorTest)""}",,26

We will learn Classification algorithms, types of classification algorithms, support vector machines(SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier in this tutorial.  Objectives Let us look at some of the objectives covered under this section of Machine Learning tutorial.  Define Classification and list its algorithms Describe Logistic Regression and Sigmoid Probability Explain K-Nearest Neighbors and KNN classification Understand Support Vector Machines, Polynomial Kernel, and Kernel Trick Analyze Kernel Support Vector Machines with an example Implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier Demonstrate Decision Tree Classifier Describe Random Forest Classifier Classification: Meaning Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.  There are 2 types of Classification:   Binomial Multi-Class Classification: Use Cases Some of the key areas where classification cases are being used:  To find whether an email received is a spam or ham To identify customer segments To find if a bank loan is granted To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination Classification: Example Social media sentiment analysis has two potential outcomes, positive or negative, as displayed by the chart given below.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/classification-example-machine-learning.JPG  This chart shows the classification of the Iris flower dataset into its three sub-species indicated by codes 0, 1, and 2. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-flower-dataset-graph.JPG  The test set dots represent the assignment of new test data points to one class or the other based on the trained classifier model. Types of Classification Algorithms Let’s have a quick look into the types of Classification Algorithm below.  Linear Models Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines Nonlinear models K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) Naïve Bayes Decision Tree Classification Random Forest Classification Logistic Regression: Meaning Let us understand the Logistic Regression model below.  This refers to a regression model that is used for classification. This method is widely used for binary classification problems. It can also be extended to multi-class classification problems. Here, the dependent variable is categorical: y ϵ {0, 1} A binary dependent variable can have only two values, like 0 or 1, win or lose, pass or fail, healthy or sick, etc In this case, you model the probability distribution of output y as 1 or 0. This is called the sigmoid probability (σ). If σ(θ Tx) > 0.5, set y = 1, else set y = 0 Unlike Linear Regression (and its Normal Equation solution), there is no closed form solution for finding optimal weights of Logistic Regression. Instead, you must solve this with maximum likelihood estimation (a probability model to detect the maximum likelihood of something happening). It can be used to calculate the probability of a given outcome in a binary model, like the probability of being classified as sick or passing an exam. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/logistic-regression-example-graph.JPG  Sigmoid Probability The probability in the logistic regression is often represented by the Sigmoid function (also called the logistic function or the S-curve):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-function-machine-learning.JPG  In this equation, t represents data values * the number of hours studied and S(t) represents the probability of passing the exam. Assume sigmoid function: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-probability-machine-learning.JPG  g(z) tends toward 1 as z -> infinity , and g(z) tends toward 0 as z -> infinity  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) K-nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to assign a data point to clusters based on similarity measurement. It uses a supervised method for classification.  The steps to writing a k-means algorithm are as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-distribution-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Choose the number of k and a distance metric. (k = 5 is common) Find k-nearest neighbors of the sample that you want to classify Assign the class label by majority vote. KNN Classification A new input point is classified in the category such that it has the most number of neighbors from that category. For example:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-classification-machine-learning.JPG  Classify a patient as high risk or low risk. Mark email as spam or ham. Keen on learning about Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning? Click here!  Support Vector Machine (SVM) Let us understand Support Vector Machine (SVM) in detail below.  SVMs are classification algorithms used to assign data to various classes. They involve detecting hyperplanes which segregate data into classes. SVMs are very versatile and are also capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and outlier detection. Once ideal hyperplanes are discovered, new data points can be easily classified. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/support-vector-machines-graph-machine-learning.JPG  The optimization objective is to find “maximum margin hyperplane” that is farthest from the closest points in the two classes (these points are called support vectors). In the given figure, the middle line represents the hyperplane. SVM Example Let’s look at this image below and have an idea about SVM in general.  Hyperplanes with larger margins have lower generalization error. The positive and negative hyperplanes are represented by: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/positive-negative-hyperplanes-machine-learning.JPG  Classification of any new input sample xtest :  If w0 + wTxtest > 1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the right of the positive hyperplane. If w0 + wTxtest < -1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the left of the negative hyperplane. When you subtract the two equations, you get:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/equation-subtraction-machine-learning.JPG  Length of vector w is (L2 norm length):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/length-of-vector-machine-learning.JPG  You normalize with the length of w to arrive at:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/normalize-equation-machine-learning.JPG  SVM: Hard Margin Classification Given below are some points to understand Hard Margin Classification.  The left side of equation SVM-1 given above can be interpreted as the distance between the positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) hyperplanes; in other words, it is the margin that can be maximized. Hence the objective of the function is to maximize with the constraint that the samples are classified correctly, which is represented as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-machine-learning.JPG  This means that you are minimizing ‖w‖. This also means that all positive samples are on one side of the positive hyperplane and all negative samples are on the other side of the negative hyperplane. This can be written concisely as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-formula.JPG  Minimizing ‖w‖ is the same as minimizing. This figure is better as it is differentiable even at w = 0. The approach listed above is called “hard margin linear SVM classifier.” SVM: Soft Margin Classification   Given below are some points to understand Soft Margin Classification.  To allow for linear constraints to be relaxed for nonlinearly separable data, a slack variable is introduced. (i) measures how much ith instance is allowed to violate the margin. The slack variable is simply added to the linear constraints. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-machine-learning.JPG  Subject to the above constraints, the new objective to be minimized becomes: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-formula.JPG  You have two conflicting objectives now—minimizing slack variable to reduce margin violations and minimizing to increase the margin. The hyperparameter C allows us to define this trade-off. Large values of C correspond to larger error penalties (so smaller margins), whereas smaller values of C allow for higher misclassification errors and larger margins. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/machine-learning-certification-video-preview.jpg  SVM: Regularization The concept of C is the reverse of regularization. Higher C means lower regularization, which increases bias and lowers the variance (causing overfitting).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/concept-of-c-graph-machine-learning.JPG  IRIS Data Set The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 IRIS flowers from three different species:  Setosa Versicolor Viriginica Each row represents one sample. Flower measurements in centimeters are stored as columns. These are called features.  IRIS Data Set: SVM Let’s train an SVM model using sci-kit-learn for the Iris dataset:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/svm-model-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Nonlinear SVM Classification There are two ways to solve nonlinear SVMs:  by adding polynomial features by adding similarity features Polynomial features can be added to datasets; in some cases, this can create a linearly separable dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/nonlinear-classification-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the figure on the left, there is only 1 feature x1. This dataset is not linearly separable. If you add x2 = (x1)2 (figure on the right), the data becomes linearly separable. Polynomial Kernel In sci-kit-learn, one can use a Pipeline class for creating polynomial features. Classification results for the Moons dataset are shown in the figure.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-machine-learning.JPG  Polynomial Kernel with Kernel Trick Let us look at the image below and understand Kernel Trick in detail.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-with-kernel-trick.JPG  For large dimensional datasets, adding too many polynomial features can slow down the model. You can apply a kernel trick with the effect of polynomial features without actually adding them. The code is shown (SVC class) below trains an SVM classifier using a 3rd-degree polynomial kernel but with a kernel trick. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-equation-machine-learning.JPG  The hyperparameter coefθ controls the influence of high-degree polynomials.  Kernel SVM Let us understand in detail about Kernel SVM.  Kernel SVMs are used for classification of nonlinear data. In the chart, nonlinear data is projected into a higher dimensional space via a mapping function where it becomes linearly separable. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the higher dimension, a linear separating hyperplane can be derived and used for classification.  A reverse projection of the higher dimension back to original feature space takes it back to nonlinear shape.  As mentioned previously, SVMs can be kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems. You can create a sample dataset for XOR gate (nonlinear problem) from NumPy. 100 samples will be assigned the class sample 1, and 100 samples will be assigned the class label -1. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-graph-machine-learning.JPG  As you can see, this data is not linearly separable.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-non-separable.JPG  You now use the kernel trick to classify XOR dataset created earlier.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-xor-machine-learning.JPG  Naïve Bayes Classifier What is Naive Bayes Classifier?  Have you ever wondered how your mail provider implements spam filtering or how online news channels perform news text classification or even how companies perform sentiment analysis of their audience on social media? All of this and more are done through a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes Classifier.  Naive Bayes Named after Thomas Bayes from the 1700s who first coined this in the Western literature. Naive Bayes classifier works on the principle of conditional probability as given by the Bayes theorem.  Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier Listed below are six benefits of Naive Bayes Classifier.  Very simple and easy to implement Needs less training data Handles both continuous and discrete data Highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points As it is fast, it can be used in real-time predictions Not sensitive to irrelevant features Bayes Theorem We will understand Bayes Theorem in detail from the points mentioned below.  According to the Bayes model, the conditional probability P(Y|X) can be calculated as:  P(Y|X) = P(X|Y)P(Y) / P(X)  This means you have to estimate a very large number of P(X|Y) probabilities for a relatively small vector space X. For example, for a Boolean Y and 30 possible Boolean attributes in the X vector, you will have to estimate 3 billion probabilities P(X|Y). To make it practical, a Naïve Bayes classifier is used, which assumes conditional independence of P(X) to each other, with a given value of Y. This reduces the number of probability estimates to 2*30=60 in the above example. Naïve Bayes Classifier for SMS Spam Detection Consider a labeled SMS database having 5574 messages. It has messages as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-machine-learning.JPG  Each message is marked as spam or ham in the data set. Let’s train a model with Naïve Bayes algorithm to detect spam from ham. The message lengths and their frequency (in the training dataset) are as shown below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-spam-detection.JPG  Analyze the logic you use to train an algorithm to detect spam:  Split each message into individual words/tokens (bag of words). Lemmatize the data (each word takes its base form, like “walking” or “walked” is replaced with “walk”). Convert data to vectors using scikit-learn module CountVectorizer. Run TFIDF to remove common words like “is,” “are,” “and.” Now apply scikit-learn module for Naïve Bayes MultinomialNB to get the Spam Detector. This spam detector can then be used to classify a random new message as spam or ham. Next, the accuracy of the spam detector is checked using the Confusion Matrix. For the SMS spam example above, the confusion matrix is shown on the right. Accuracy Rate = Correct / Total = (4827 + 592)/5574 = 97.21% Error Rate = Wrong / Total = (155 + 0)/5574 = 2.78% https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/confusion-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Although confusion Matrix is useful, some more precise metrics are provided by Precision and Recall.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-recall-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Precision refers to the accuracy of positive predictions.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Recall refers to the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier (also known as True positive rate or TPR).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/recall-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Precision/Recall Trade-off To detect age-appropriate videos for kids, you need high precision (low recall) to ensure that only safe videos make the cut (even though a few safe videos may be left out).  The high recall is needed (low precision is acceptable) in-store surveillance to catch shoplifters; a few false alarms are acceptable, but all shoplifters must be caught.  Learn about Naive Bayes in detail. Click here!  Decision Tree Classifier Some aspects of the Decision Tree Classifier mentioned below are.  Decision Trees (DT) can be used both for classification and regression. The advantage of decision trees is that they require very little data preparation. They do not require feature scaling or centering at all. They are also the fundamental components of Random Forests, one of the most powerful ML algorithms. Unlike Random Forests and Neural Networks (which do black-box modeling), Decision Trees are white box models, which means that inner workings of these models are clearly understood. In the case of classification, the data is segregated based on a series of questions. Any new data point is assigned to the selected leaf node. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-machine-learning.JPG  Start at the tree root and split the data on the feature using the decision algorithm, resulting in the largest information gain (IG). This splitting procedure is then repeated in an iterative process at each child node until the leaves are pure. This means that the samples at each node belonging to the same class. In practice, you can set a limit on the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting. The purity is compromised here as the final leaves may still have some impurity. The figure shows the classification of the Iris dataset. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-graph.JPG  IRIS Decision Tree Let’s build a Decision Tree using scikit-learn for the Iris flower dataset and also visualize it using export_graphviz API.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-machine-learning.JPG  The output of export_graphviz can be converted into png format:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-output.JPG  Sample attribute stands for the number of training instances the node applies to. Value attribute stands for the number of training instances of each class the node applies to. Gini impurity measures the node’s impurity. A node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/impurity-formula-machine-learning.JPG  For example, for Versicolor (green color node), the Gini is 1-(0/54)2 -(49/54)2 -(5/54) 2 ≈ 0.168  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-sample.JPG  Decision Boundaries Let us learn to create decision boundaries below.  For the first node (depth 0), the solid line splits the data (Iris-Setosa on left). Gini is 0 for Setosa node, so no further split is possible. The second node (depth 1) splits the data into Versicolor and Virginica. If max_depth were set as 3, a third split would happen (vertical dotted line). https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-boundaries.JPG  For a sample with petal length 5 cm and petal width 1.5 cm, the tree traverses to depth 2 left node, so the probability predictions for this sample are 0% for Iris-Setosa (0/54), 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor (49/54), and 9.3% for Iris-Virginica (5/54) CART Training Algorithm Scikit-learn uses Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to train Decision Trees. CART algorithm:  Split the data into two subsets using a single feature k and threshold tk (example, petal length < “2.45 cm”). This is done recursively for each node. k and tk are chosen such that they produce the purest subsets (weighted by their size). The objective is to minimize the cost function as given below: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/cart-training-algorithm-machine-learning.JPG  The algorithm stops executing if one of the following situations occurs: max_depth is reached No further splits are found for each node Other hyperparameters may be used to stop the tree: min_samples_split min_samples_leaf min_weight_fraction_leaf max_leaf_nodes Gini Impurity or Entropy Entropy is one more measure of impurity and can be used in place of Gini.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/gini-impurity-entrophy.JPG  It is a degree of uncertainty, and Information Gain is the reduction that occurs in entropy as one traverses down the tree. Entropy is zero for a DT node when the node contains instances of only one class. Entropy for depth 2 left node in the example given above is:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/entrophy-for-depth-2.JPG  Gini and Entropy both lead to similar trees.  DT: Regularization The following figure shows two decision trees on the moons dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/dt-regularization-machine-learning.JPG  The decision tree on the right is restricted by min_samples_leaf = 4. The model on the left is overfitting, while the model on the right generalizes better. Random Forest Classifier Let us have an understanding of Random Forest Classifier below.  A random forest can be considered an ensemble of decision trees (Ensemble learning). Random Forest algorithm: Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n samples from the training set). Grow a decision tree from the bootstrap sample. At each node, randomly select d features. Split the node using the feature that provides the best split according to the objective function, for instance by maximizing the information gain. Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times. (k is the number of trees you want to create, using a subset of samples) Aggregate the prediction by each tree for a new data point to assign the class label by majority vote (pick the group selected by the most number of trees and assign new data point to that group). Random Forests are opaque, which means it is difficult to visualize their inner workings. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/random-forest-classifier-graph.JPG  However, the advantages outweigh their limitations since you do not have to worry about hyperparameters except k, which stands for the number of decision trees to be created from a subset of samples. RF is quite robust to noise from the individual decision trees. Hence, you need not prune individual decision trees. The larger the number of decision trees, the more accurate the Random Forest prediction is. (This, however, comes with higher computation cost). Key Takeaways Let us quickly run through what we have learned so far in this Classification tutorial.  Classification algorithms are supervised learning methods to split data into classes. They can work on Linear Data as well as Nonlinear Data. Logistic Regression can classify data based on weighted parameters and sigmoid conversion to calculate the probability of classes. K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses similar features to classify data. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify data by detecting the maximum margin hyperplane between data classes. Naïve Bayes, a simplified Bayes Model, can help classify data using conditional probability models. Decision Trees are powerful classifiers and use tree splitting logic until pure or somewhat pure leaf node classes are attained. Random Forests apply Ensemble Learning to Decision Trees for more accurate classification predictions. Conclusion This completes ‘Classification’ tutorial.

It also aims at getting you to familiarize yourselves with the inetd superserver daemon, the ‘exec’ family of functions, various socket error scenarios, some socket options, and some basic domain name / IP address conversion functions. Apart from the material in Chapters 1 to 6 covered in class, you will also need to refer to the following :  the exec family of functions (Section 4.7 of Chapter 4)  using pipes for interprocess communication (IPC) in Unix  error scenarios induced by process terminations & host crashes (Sections 5.11 to 5.16, Chapter 5)  setsockopt function & SO_REUSEADDR socket option (Section 7.2 & pp.210-213, Chapter 7)  gethostbyname & gethostbyaddr functions (Sections 11.3 & 11.4, Chapter 11)  the basic structure of inetd (Section 13.5, Chapter 13)  programming with threads (Sections 26.1 to 26.5, Chapter 26) Overview  I shall present an overview of this assignment and discuss some of the specification details given below in class on Wednesday, September 17 & Monday, September 22.  Client  The client is evoked with a command line argument giving either the server IP address in dotted decimal notation, or the server domain name. The client has to be able to handle either mode and figure out which of the two is being passed to it. If it is given the IP address, it calls the gethostbyaddr function to get the domain name, which it then prints out to the user in the form of an appropriate message (e.g., ‘The server host is compserv1.cs.stonybrook.edu’). The function gethostbyname, on the other hand, returns the IP address that corresponds to a given domain name. The client then enters an infinite loop in which it queries the user which service is being requested. There are two options : echo and time (note that time is a slightly modified version of the daytime service – see below). The client then forks off a child. After the child is forked off, the parent process enters a second loop in which it continually reads and prints out status messages received from the child via a half-duplex pipe (see below). The parent exits the second loop when the child closes the pipe (how does the parent detect this?), and/or the SIGCHLD signal is generated when the child terminates. The parent then repeats the outer loop, querying the user again for the (next) service s/he desires. This cycle continues till the user responds to a query with quit rather than echo or time.  The child process is the one which handles the actual service for the user. It execs (see Section 4.7, Chapter 4) an xterm to generate a separate window through which all interactions with server and user take place. For example, the following exec function call evokes an xterm, and gets the xterm to execute echocli, located in the current directory, passing the string 127.0.0.1 (assumed to be the IP address of the server) as the command line argument argv[1] to echocli (click on the url for further details) :  execlp(""xterm"", ""xterm"", ""-e"", ""./echocli"", ""127.0.0.1"", (char *) 0)  xterm executes one of two client programs (echocli or timecli, say) depending on the service requested. A client program establishes a TCP connection to the server at the ‘well-known port’ for the service (in reality, this port will, of course, be some ephemeral port of your choosing, the value of which is known to both server and client code). All interaction with the user, on the one hand, and with the server, on the other, takes place through the child’s xterm window, not the parent’s window. On the other hand, the child will use a half-duplex pipe to relay status information to the parent which the parent prints out in its window (see below).To terminate the echo client, the user can type in ^D (CTRL D, the EOF character). To terminate the time client, the only option is for the user to type in ^C (CTRL C). (This can also be used as an alternative means of terminating the echo client.) Note that using ^C in the context of the time service will give the server process the impression that the client process has ‘crashed’. It is your responsibility to ensure that the server process handles this correctly and closes cleanly. I shall address this further when discussing the server process.  It is also part of your responsibility in this assignment to ensure that the client code is robust with respect to the server process crashing (see Sections 5.12 & 5.13, Chapter 5). Amongst other implications, this means that it would probably be a good idea for you to implement your echo client code along the lines of either : Figure 6.9, p.168 (or even Figure 6.13, p.174) which uses I/O multiplexing with the select function; or of Figure 26.2, p.680, which uses threads; rather than along the lines of Figure 5.5, p.125.  When the child terminates, either normally or abnormally, its xterm window disappears instantaneously. Consequently, any status information that the child might want to communicate to the user should not be printed out on the child’s xterm window, since the user will not have time to see the final such message before the window disappears. Instead, as the parent forks off the child at the beginning, a half-duplex pipe should be established from child to parent. The child uses the pipe to send status reports to the parent, which the parent prints out in its window. I leave it up to you to decide what status information exactly should be relayed to the parent but, at a minimum, the parent should certainly be notified, in as precise terms as possible, of any abnormal termination conditions of the service provided by the child.  In general, you should try to make your code as robust as possible with respect to handling errors, including confused behaviour by the user (e.g., passing an invalid command line argument; responding to a query incorrectly; trying to interact with the service through the parent process window, not the child process xterm; etc.). Amongst other things, you have to worry about EINTR errors occurring during slow system calls (such as the parent reading from the pipe, or, possibly, printing to stdout, for example) due to a SIGCHLD signal. What about other kinds of errors? Which ones can occur? How should you handle them?  Server  The server has to be able to handle multiple clients using threads (specifically, detached threads), not child processes (see Sections 26.1 to 26.4, Chapter 26). Furthermore, it has to be able to handle multiple types of service; in our case, two : echo and time. echo is just the standard echo service we have seen in class. time is a slightly modified version of the daytime service (see Figure 1.9, p.14) : instead of sending the client the ‘daytime’ just once and closing, the service sits in an infinite loop, sending the ‘daytime’, sleeping for 5 seconds, and repeating, ad infinitum.  The server is loosely based on the way the inetd daemon works : see Figure 13.7, p.374. However, note that the differences between inetd and our server are probably more significant than the similarities: inetd forks off children, whereas our server uses threads; inetd child processes issue exec commands, which our server threads do not; etc. So you should treat Figure 13.7 (and Section 13.5, Chapter 13, generally) as a source of ideas, not as a set of specifications which you must slavishly adhere to and copy. Note, by the way, that there are some similarities between our client and inetd (primarily, forking off children which issue execs), which could be a useful source of ideas.  The server creates a listening socket for each type of service that it handles, bound to the ‘well-known port’ for that service. It then uses select to await clients (Chapter 6; or, if you prefer, poll; note that pselect is not supported in Solaris 2.10). The socket on which a client connects identifies the service the client is seeking. The server accepts the connection and creates a thread which provides the service. The thread detaches itself. Meanwhile, the main thread goes back to the select to await further clients.  A major concern when using threads is to make sure that operations are thread safe (see p.685 and on into Section 26.5). In this respect, Stevens’ readline function (in Stevens’ file unpv13e/lib/readline.c, see Figure 3.18, pp.91-92) poses a particular problem. On p.686, the authors give three options for dealing with this. The third option is too inefficient and should be discarded. You can implement the second option if you wish. Easiest of all would be the first option, since it involves using a thread-safe version of readline (see Figures 26.11 & 26.12) provided in file unpv13e/threads/readline.c. Whatever you do, remember that Stevens’ library, libunp.a, contains the non-thread-safe version of Figure 3.18, and that is the version that will be link-loaded to your code unless you undertake explicit steps to ensure this does not happen (libunp.a also contains the ‘wrapper’ function Readline, whose code is also in file unpv13e/lib/readline.c). Remaking your copy of libunp.a with the ‘correct’ version of readline is not a viable option because when you hand in your code, it will be compiled and link-loaded with respect to the version of libunp.a in the course account, ~cse533/Stevens/unpv13e_solaris2.10 (I do not intend to change that version since it risks creating confusion later on in the course). Also, you will probably want to use the original version of readline in the client code anyway. I am providing you with a sample Makefile which picks up the thread-safe version of readline from directory ~cse533/Stevens/unpv13e_solaris2.10/threads and uses it when making the executable for the server, but leaves the other executables it makes to link-load the non-thread-safe version from libunp.a.  Again, it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your server code is as robust as possible with respect to errors, and that the server threads terminate cleanly under all circumstances. Recall, first of all, that the client user will often use ^C (CTRL C) in the xterm to terminate the service. This will appear to the server thread as if the client process has crashed. You need to think about the error conditions that will be induced (see Sections 5.11 to 5.13, Chapter 5), and how the echo and time server code is to detect and handle these conditions. For example, the time server will almost certainly experience an EPIPE error (see Section 5.13). How should the associated SIGPIPE signal be handled? Be aware that when we return out of the Stevens’ writen function with -1 (indicating an error) and check errno, errno is sometimes equal to 0, not EPIPE (value 32). This can happen under Solaris 2.10, but I am not sure under precisely what conditions nor why. Nor am I sure if it also happens under other Unix versions, or if it also happens when using write rather than writen. The point is, you cannot depend on errno to find out what has happened to the write or writen functions. My suggestion, therefore, is that the time server should use the select function. On the one hand, select’s timeout mechanism can be used to make the server sleep for the 5 seconds. On the other hand, select should also monitor the connection socket read event because, when the client xterm is ^C’ed, a FIN will be sent to the server TCP, which will prime the socket for reading; a read on the socket will then return with value 0 (see Figure 14.3, p. 385 as an example).  But what about errors other than EPIPE? Which ones can occur? How should you handle them? Recall, as well, that if a thread terminates without explicitly closing the connection socket it has been using, the connection socket will remain existent until the server process itself dies (why?). Since the server process is supposed, in principle, to run for ever, you risk ending up with an ever increasing number of unused, ‘orphaned’ sockets unless you are careful.  Whenever a server thread detects the termination of its client, it should print out a message giving appropriate details: e.g., “Client termination: EPIPE error detected”, “Client termination: socket read returned with value 0”, “Client termination: socket read returned with value -1, errno = . . .”, and so on.  When debugging your server code, you will probably find that restarting the server very shortly after it was last running will give you trouble when it comes to bind to its ‘well-known ports’. This is because, when the server side initiates connection termination (which is what will happen if the server process crashes; or if you kill it first, before killing the client) TCP keeps the connections open in the TIME_WAIT state for 2MSLs (Sections 2.6 & 2.7, Chapter 2). This could very quickly become a major irritant. I suggest you explore the possibility of using the SO_REUSEADDR socket option (pp.210-213, Chapter 7; note that the SO_REUSEPORT socket option is not supported in Solaris 2.10), which should help keep the stress level down. You will need to use the setsockopt function (Section 7.2) to enable this option. Figure 8.24, p.263, shows an instance of server code that sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option.  Finally, you should be aware of the sort of problem, described in Section 16.6, pp.461-463, that might occur when (blocking) listening sockets are monitored using select. Such sockets should be made nonblocking, which requires use of the fcntl  function after socket creates the socket, but before listen turns the socket into a listening socket.",,22

This will then automatically send the location and video straight to the police or friend. The application also can activate using voice recognition e.g. when the word “help” is said. Along with the voice recognition, if the voice reaches a certain decibel level then it will activate. With the app I also developed a website which will be able to take in the videos and also display all them. There is a Servlet on the server that takes in the videos and then converts them into the necessary format to display them on the site. After conversion it then stores the video in a database for record. This website only can be used by authorised individuals through a login system. I also developed a statistics analysis page to discover the number of attacks in each area in a particular country. Various other additives where implemented on the app such as sending the video through email, created an animation on how to use the app and application multi language selection. ",,18
