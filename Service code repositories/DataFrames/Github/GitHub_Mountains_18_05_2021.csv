0,https://github.com/SOYJUN/FTP-implement-based-on-UDP.git,"The aim of this assignment is to have you do UDP socket client / server programming with a focus on two broad aspects :  Setting up the exchange between the client and server in a secure way despite the lack of a formal connection (as in TCP) between the two, so that ‘outsider’ UDP datagrams (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) cannot intrude on the communication.  Introducing application-layer protocol data-transmission reliability, flow control and congestion control in the client and server using TCP-like ARQ sliding window mechanisms. The second item above is much more of a challenge to implement than the first, though neither is particularly trivial. But they are not tightly interdependent; each can be worked on separately at first and then integrated together at a later stage.  Apart from the material in Chapters 8, 14 & 22 (especially Sections 22.5 - 22.7), and the experience you gained from the preceding assignment, you will also need to refer to the following :  ioctl function (Chapter 17).  get_ifi_info function (Section 17.6, Chapter 17). This function will be used by the server code to discover its node’s network interfaces so that it can bind all its interface IP addresses (see Section 22.6).  ‘Race’ conditions (Section 20.5, Chapter 20) You also need a thorough understanding of how the TCP protocol implements reliable data transfer, flow control and congestion control. Chapters 17- 24 of   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1  by W. Richard Stevens gives a good overview of TCP. Though somewhat dated for some things (it was published in 1994), it remains, overall, a good basic reference.  Overview  This assignment asks you to implement a primitive file transfer protocol for Unix platforms, based on UDP, and with TCP-like reliability added to the transfer operation using timeouts and sliding-window mechanisms, and implementing flow and congestion control. The server is a concurrent server which can handle multiple clients simultaneously. A client gives the server the name of a file. The server forks off a child which reads directly from the file and transfers the contents over to the client using UDP datagrams. The client prints out the file contents as they come in, in order, with nothing missing and with no duplication of content, directly on to stdout (via the receiver sliding window, of course, but with no other intermediate buffering). The file to be transferred can be of arbitrary length, but its contents are always straightforward ascii text.  As an aside let me mention that assuming the file contents ascii is not as restrictive as it sounds. We can always pretend, for example, that binary files are base64 encoded (“ASCII armor”). A real file transfer protocol would, of course, have to worry about transferring files between heterogeneous platforms with different file structure conventions and semantics. The sender would first have to transform the file into a platform-independent, protocol-defined, format (using, say, ASN.1, or some such standard), and the receiver would have to transform the received file into its platform’s native file format. This kind of thing can be fairly time consuming, and is certainly very tedious, to implement, with little educational value - it is not part of this assignment.  Arguments for the server  You should provide the server with an input file server.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  Well-known port number for server. Maximum sending sliding-window size (in datagram units). You will not be handing in your server.in file. We shall create our own when we come to test your code. So it is important that you stick strictly to the file name and content conventions specified above. The same applies to the client.in input file below.  Arguments for the client  The client is to be provided with an input file client.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  IP address of server (not the hostname). Well-known port number of server. filename to be transferred. Receiving sliding-window size (in datagram units). Random generator seed value. Probability p of datagram loss. This should be a real number in the range [ 0.0 , 1.0 ]  (value 0.0 means no loss occurs; value 1.0 means all datagrams all lost). The mean µ, in milliseconds, for an exponential distribution controlling the rate at which the client reads received datagram payloads from its receive buffer. Operation  Server starts up and reads its arguments from file server.in.  As we shall see, when a client communicates with the server, the server will want to know what IP address that client is using to identify the server (i.e. , the destination IP address in the incoming datagram). Normally, this can be done relatively straightforwardly using the IP_RECVDESTADDR socket option, and picking up the information using the ancillary data (‘control information’) capability of the recvmsg function. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support the IP_RECVDESTADDR option (nor, incidentally, does it support the msg_flags option in msghdr - see p.390). This considerably complicates things.  In the absence of IP_RECVDESTADDR, what the server has to do as part of its initialization phase is to bind each IP address it has (and, simultaneously, its well-known port number, which it has read in from server.in) to a separate UDP socket. The code in Section 22.6, which uses the get_ifi_info function, shows you how to do that. However, there are important differences between that code and the version you want to implement. The code of Section 22.6 binds the IP addresses and forks off a child for each address that is bound to. We do not want to do that. Instead you should have an array of socket descriptors. For each IP address, create a new socket and bind the address (and well-known port number) to the socket without forking off child processes. Creating child processes comes later, when clients arrive.  The code of Section 22.6 also attempts to bind broadcast addresses. We do not want to do this. It binds a wildcard IP address, which we certainly do not want to do either. We should bind strictly only unicast addresses (including the loopback address).  The get_ifi_info function (which the code in Section 22.6 uses) has to be modified so that it also gets the network masks for the IP addresses of the node, and adds these to the information stored in the linked list of ifi_info structures (see Figure 17.5, p.471) it produces. As you go binding each IP address to a distinct socket, it will be useful for later processing to build your own array of structures, where a structure element records the following information for each socket :  sockfd IP address bound to the socket network mask for the IP address subnet address (obtained by doing a bit-wise and between the IP address and its network mask)  Report, in a ReadMe file which you hand in with your code, on the modifications you had to introduce to ensure that only unicast addresses are bound, and on your implementation of the array of structures described above.  You should print out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted in dotted decimal notation, the IP address, network mask, and subnet address for each socket in your array of structures (you do not need to print the sockfd).  The server now uses select to monitor the sockets it has created for incoming datagrams. When it returns from select, it must use recvfrom or recvmsg to read the incoming datagram (see 6. below).  When a client starts, it first reads its arguments from the file client.in.  The client checks if the server host is ‘local’ to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the server is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option). It determines if the server host is ‘local’ as follows. The first thing the client should do is to use the modified get_ifi_info function to obtain all of its IP addresses and associated network masks.  Print out on stdout, in dotted decimal notation and with an appropriate message, the IP addresses and network masks obtained.  In the following, IPserver designates the IP address the client will use to identify the server, and IPclient designates the IP address the client will choose to identify itself.  The client checks whether the server is on the same host. If so, it should use the loopback address 127.0.0.1 for the server (i.e. , IPserver = 127.0.0.1). IPclient should also be set to the loopback address.  Otherwise it proceeds as follows:  IPserver is set to the IP address for the server in the client.in file. Given IPserver and the (unicast) IP addresses and network masks for the client returned by get_ifi_info in the linked list of ifi_info structures, you should be able to figure out if the server node is ‘local’ or not. This will be discussed in class; but let me just remind you here that you should use ‘longest prefix matching’ where applicable.  If there are multiple client addresses, and the server host is ‘local’, the client chooses an IP address for itself, IPclient, which matches up as ‘local’ according to your examination above. If the server host is not ‘local’, then IPclient can be chosen arbitrarily.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the server host is ‘local’ or not, as well as the IPclient and IPserver addresses selected.  Note that this manner of determining whether the server is local or not is somewhat clumsy and ‘over-engineered’, and, as such, should be viewed more in the nature of a pedagogical exercise. Ideally, we would like to look up the server IP address(es) in the routing table (see Section 18.3). This requires that a routing socket be created, for which we need superuser privilege. Alternatively, we might want to dump out the routing table, using the sysctl function for example (see Section 18.4), and examine it directly. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support sysctl.   Furthermore, note that there is a slight problem with the address 130.245.1.123/24 assigned to compserv3 (see rightmost column of file hosts, and note that this particular compserv3 address “overlaps” with the 130.245.1.x/28 addresses in that same column assigned to compserv1, compserv2 & comserv4). In particular, if the client is running on compserv3 and the server on any of the other three compservs, and if that server node is also being identified to the client by its /28 (rather than its /24) address, then the client will get a “false positive” when it tests as to whether the server node is local or not. In other words, the client will deem the server node to be local, whereas in fact it should not be considered local. Because of this, it is perhaps best simply not to use compserv3 to run the client (but it is o.k. to use it to run the server).   Finally, using MSG_DONTROUTE where possible would seem to gain us efficiency, in as much as the kernel does not need to consult the routing table for every datagram sent. But, in fact, that is not so. Recall that one effect of connect with UDP sockets is that routing information is obtained by the kernel at the time the connect is issued. That information is cached and used for subsequent sends from the connected socket (see p.255).  The client now creates a UDP socket and calls bind on IPclient, with 0 as the port number. This will cause the kernel to bind an ephemeral port to the socket.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPclient and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client connects its socket to IPserver and the well-known port number of the server.  After the connect, use the getpeername function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the well-known port number of the server, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client sends a datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer. This send needs to be backed up by a timeout in case the datagram is lost.  Note that the incoming datagram from the client will be delivered to the server at the socket to which the destination IP address that the datagram is carrying has been bound. Thus, the server can obtain that address (it is, of course, IPserver) and thereby achieve what IP_RECVDESTADDR would have given us had it been available.  Furthermore, the server process can obtain the IP address (this will, of course, be IPclient) and ephemeral port number of the client through the recvfrom or recvmsg functions.  The server forks off a child process to handle the client. The server parent process goes back to the select to listen for new clients. Hereafter, and unless otherwise stated, whenever we refer to the ‘server’, we mean the server child process handling the client’s file transfer, not the server parent process.  Typically, the first thing the server child would be expected to do is to close all sockets it ‘inherits’ from its parent. However, this is not the case with us. The server child does indeed close the sockets it inherited, but not the socket on which the client request arrived. It leaves that socket open for now. Call this socket the ‘listening’ socket.  The server (child) then checks if the client host is local to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the client is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option).  If IPserver (obtained in 5. above) is the loopback address, then we are done. Otherwise, the server has to proceed with the following step.  Use the array of structures you built in 1. above, together with the addresses IPserver and IPclient to determine if the client is ‘local’.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the client host is ‘local’ or not. The server (child) creates a UDP socket to handle file transfer to the client. Call this socket the ‘connection’ socket. It binds the socket to IPserver, with port number 0 so that its kernel assigns an ephemeral port.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The server then connects this ‘connection’ socket to the client’s IPclient and ephemeral port number.  The server now sends the client a datagram, in which it passes it the ephemeral port number of its ‘connection’ socket as the data payload of the datagram. This datagram is sent using the ‘listening’ socket inherited from its parent, otherwise the client (whose socket is connected to the server’s ‘listening’ socket at the latter’s well-known port number) will reject it. This datagram must be backed up by the ARQ mechanism, and retransmitted in the event of loss.  Note that if this datagram is indeed lost, the client might well time out and retransmit its original request message (the one carrying the file name). In this event, you must somehow ensure that the parent server does not mistake this retransmitted request for a new client coming in, and spawn off yet another child to handle it. How do you do that? It is potentially more involved than it might seem. I will be discussing this in class, as well as ‘race’ conditions that could potentially arise, depending on how you code the mechanisms I present.  When the client receives the datagram carrying the ephemeral port number of the server’s ‘connection’ socket, it reconnects its socket to the server’s ‘connection’ socket, using IPserver and the ephemeral port number received in the datagram (see p.254). It now uses this reconnected socket to send the server an acknowledgment. Note that this implies that, in the event of the server timing out, it should retransmit two copies of its ‘ephemeral port number’ message, one on its ‘listening’ socket and the other on its ‘connection’ socket (why?).  When the server receives the acknowledgment, it closes the ‘listening’ socket it inherited from its parent. The server can now commence the file transfer through its ‘connection’ socket.  The net effect of all these binds and connects at server and client is that no ‘outsider’ UDP datagram (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) can now intrude on the communication between server and client.  Starting with the first datagram sent out, the client behaves as follows.  Whenever a datagram arrives, or an ACK is about to be sent out (or, indeed, the initial datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer), the client uses some random number generator function random() (initialized by the client.in argument value seed) to decide with probability p (another client.in argument value) if the datagram or ACK should be discarded by way of simulating transmission loss across the network. (I will briefly discuss in class how you do this.) Adding reliability to UDP  The mechanisms you are to implement are based on TCP Reno. These include :  Reliable data transmission using ARQ sliding-windows, with Fast Retransmit. Flow control via receiver window advertisements. Congestion control that implements : SlowStart Congestion Avoidance (‘Additive-Increase/Multiplicative Decrease’ – AIMD) Fast Recovery (but without the window-inflation aspect of Fast Recovery) Only some, and by no means all, of the details for these are covered below. The rest will be presented in class, especially those concerning flow control and TCP Reno’s congestion control mechanisms in general :  Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery.  Implement a timeout mechanism on the sender (server) side. This is available to you from Stevens, Section 22.5 . Note, however, that you will need to modify the basic driving mechanism of Figure 22.7 appropriately since the situation at the sender side is not a repetitive cycle of send-receive, but rather a straightforward progression of send-send-send-send- . . . . . . . . . . .  Also, modify the RTT and RTO mechanisms of Section 22.5 as specified below. I will be discussing the details of these modifications and the reasons for them in class.  Modify function rtt_stop (Fig. 22.13) so that it uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point. This will entail your also having to modify some of the variable and function parameter declarations throughout Section 22.5 from float to int, as appropriate.  In the unprrt.h header file (Fig. 22.10) set :           RTT_RXTMIN   to 1000 msec.   (1 sec. instead of the current value   3 sec.)           RTT_RXTMAX  to 3000 msec.   (3 sec. instead of the current value 60 sec.)           RTT_MAXNREXMT  to 12        (instead of the current value 3)  In function rtt_timeout (Fig. 22.14), after doubling the RTO in line 86, pass its value through the function rtt_minmax of Fig. 22.11 (somewhat along the lines of what is done in line 77 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Finally, note that with the modification to integer calculation of the smoothed RTT and its variation, and given the small RTT values you will experience on the cs / sbpub network, these calculations should probably now be done on a millisecond or even microsecond scale (rather than in seconds, as is the case with Stevens’ code). Otherwise, small measured RTTs could show up as 0 on a scale of seconds, yielding a negative result when we subtract the smoothed RTT from the measured RTT (line 72 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Report the details of your modifications to the code of Section 22.5 in the ReadMe file which you hand in with your code.  We need to have a sender sliding window mechanism for the retransmission of lost datagrams; and a receiver sliding window in order to ensure correct sequencing of received file contents, and some measure of flow control. You should implement something based on TCP Reno’s mechanisms, with cumulative acknowledgments, receiver window advertisements, and a congestion control mechanism I will explain in detail in class.  For a reference on TCP’s mechanisms generally, see W. Richard Stevens,   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 , especially Sections 20.2 - 20.4  of  Chapter 20 ,  and Sections 21.1 - 21.8  of  Chapter 21 .  Bear in mind that our sequence numbers should count datagrams, not bytes as in TCP. Remember that the sender and receiver window sizes have to be set according to the argument values in client.in and server.in, respectively. Whenever the sender window becomes full and so ‘locks’, the server should print out a message to that effect on stdout. Similarly, whenever the receiver window ‘locks’, the client should print out a message on stdout.  Be aware of the potential for deadlock when the receiver window ‘locks’. This situation is handled by having the receiver process send a duplicate ACK which acts as a window update when its window opens again (see  Figure 20.3  and the discussion about it in TCP/IP Illustrated). However, this is not enough, because ACKs are not backed up by a timeout mechanism in the event they are lost. So we will also need to implement a persist timer driving window probes in the sender process (see  Sections 22.1 & 22.2  in Chapter 22 of TCP/IP Illustrated). Note that you do not have to worry about the Silly Window Syndrome discussed in Section 22.3 of TCP/IP Illustrated since the receiver process consumes ‘full sized’ 512-byte messages from the receiver buffer (see 3. below).  Report on the details of the ARQ mechanism you implemented in the ReadMe file you hand in. Indeed, you should report on all the TCP mechanisms you implemented in the ReadMe file, both the ones discussed here, and the ones I will be discussing in class.  Make your datagram payload a fixed 512 bytes, inclusive of the file transfer protocol header (which must, at the very least, carry: the sequence number of the datagram; ACKs; and advertised window notifications).  The client reads the file contents in its receive buffer and prints them out on stdout using a separate thread. This thread sits in a repetitive loop till all the file contents have been printed out, doing the following.  It samples from an exponential distribution with mean µ milliseconds (read from the client.in file), sleeps for that number of milliseconds; wakes up to read and print all in-order file contents available in the receive buffer at that point; samples again from the exponential distribution; sleeps; and so on.  The formula     -1 × µ × ln( random( ) ) ,    where ln is the natural logarithm, yields variates from an exponential distribution with mean µ, based on the uniformly-distributed variates over  ( 0 , 1 )  returned by random().  Note that you will need to implement some sort of mutual exclusion/semaphore mechanism on the client side so that the thread that sleeps and wakes up to consume from the receive buffer is not updating the state variables of the buffer at the same time as the main thread reading from the socket and depositing into the buffer is doing the same. Furthermore, we need to ensure that the main thread does not effectively monopolize the semaphore (and thus lock out for prolonged periods of time) the sleeping thread when the latter wakes up. See the textbook, Section 26.7, ‘Mutexes: Mutual Exclusion’,  pp.697-701. You might also find Section 26.8, ‘Condition Variables’,  pp.701-705, useful.  You will need to devise some way by which the sender can notify the receiver when it has sent the last datagram of the file transfer, without the receiver mistaking that EOF marker as part of the file contents. (Also, note that the last data segment could be a “short” segment of less than 512 bytes – your client needs to be able to handle this correctly somehow.) When the sender receives an ACK for the last datagram of the transfer, the (child) server terminates. The parent server has to take care of cleaning up zombie children.  Note that if we want a clean closing, the client process cannot simply terminate when the receiver ACKs the last datagram. This ACK could be lost, which would leave the (child) server process ‘hanging’, timing out, and retransmitting the last datagram. TCP attempts to deal with this problem by means of the TIME_WAIT state. You should have your receiver process behave similarly, sticking around in something akin to a TIME_WAIT state in case in case it needs to retransmit the ACK.  In the ReadMe file you hand in, report on how you dealt with the issues raised here: sender notifying receiver of the last datagram, clean closing, and so on. Output  Some of the output required from your program has been described in the section Operation above. I expect you to provide further output – clear, well-structured, well-laid-out, concise but sufficient and helpful – in the client and server windows by means of which we can trace the correct evolution of your TCP’s behaviour in all its intricacies :  information (e.g., sequence number) on datagrams and acks sent and dropped, window advertisements, datagram retransmissions (and why :  dup acks or RTO); entering/exiting Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance, ssthresh and cwnd values; sender and receiver windows locking/unlocking; etc., etc. . . .  .  The onus is on you to convince us that the TCP mechanisms you implemented are working correctly. Too many students do not put sufficient thought, creative imagination, time or effort into this. It is not the TA’s nor my responsibility to sit staring at an essentially blank screen, trying to summon up our paranormal psychology skills to figure out if your TCP implementation is really working correctly in all its very intricate aspects, simply because the transferred file seems to be printing o.k. in the client window. Nor is it our responsibility to strain our eyes and our patience wading through a mountain of obscure, ill-structured, hyper-messy, debugging-style output because, for example, your effort-conserving concept of what is ‘suitable’ is to dump your debugging output on us, relevant, irrelevant, and everything in between.",,36

Existing cloud gaming systems suffer from low GPU utilization in the virtualized environment. Moreover, GPU resources are scheduled in units of virtual machines (VMs) and this kind of coarse-grained scheduling at the VM-level fails to fully exploit GPU processing capacity. ShareRender offloads graphics workloads within VMs directly to GPUs, bypassing GPU virtualization. For each game running in a VM, ShareRender starts a graphics wrapper to intercept frame rendering requests and assign them to render agents responsible for frame rendering on GPUs. Thanks to the flexible workload assignment among multiple render agents, ShareRender enables fine-grained resource sharing at the frame-level to significantly improve GPU utilization.  If you want to know more about ShareRender, please refer to our paper in Multimedia 2017.

This is a game to map my experience in Disney World, in Orlando during this spring break.   However, because of my limited skills in computer science, I really have no idea how to simplify the process to run the game. Sorry for the inconvenience.   In order to run the game, you may need to install JAVA. I hope the following links will help you. \xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk\u2028\xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs1331/guides/install-java.html  My main file is called Disney. You can call Disney in console to start the game. However, I failed to putting all the things inside Disney file. Therefore, you may also need to call AdventureLand, MainStreet, and FrontierLand to start other three games.   I hope this will help you. Sorry again for the inconvenience.     1. the structure of my project   My project only focused on my trip in Magic Kingdom, one part of Disney world in Orlando. It is a game which guides players to choose from six sub-games, which match six sections of the park, Main Street U.S.A, Tomorrowland, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Liberty Square. I chose one of the rides I took in each section which, from my perspective, shows what I found interesting in Disney world. I changed what I experienced in the park into a small computer game. I want to share my experience with others while they play my games. In the following part of self reflection, I explain the background, rules and other things about each game. For convenience of matching them, I use different color to mark different parts. I hope it will help readers a little bit when they are lost in my disordered reflections.   1. the hall of presidents - Liberty Square   2. Festivall parade - Fantasyland (I explain this one in the part of technology skill limitations)   3. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad - Frontierland   4.talking with Woody- Adventureland    5. Stitch Store - Tomorrowland      6. lunch time - Main Street USA      3. my reflection of the trip in Disney World  from dream to reality    When I exited Disney resort, I found a sign along the street welcomed people back to real world. Actually, when I was in Orlando, I couldn\'t believe as an adult, people can mess up fantasy world in the theme parks and the real world. Nevertheless, I felt I was still in fantasy world, when I dreamed twice that I fought for the key to open the door of future. As is known to all, while sleeping, people always dream about what people thinks in the daytime. Therefore, my dream shows that my mind still stayed in the world with Mickey and Donald.    I believe that it is experiencing fantasy world which is the source of the greatest happiness people get from theme park. On the one hand, everybody has pressure in real life especially for adults. They can get out of pressure for a day trip in theme park. They can experience different lives here with cartoon characters. On the other hand, sometimes, it is a really hard task to fulfill some dreams, such as being a princess. However, in Disney world, you can dress up the same as Snow White, waiting for your prince; you can go to space by rocket; you can also travel all over the world in one day and enjoy the food of each country. These are all the magic of theme parks.    Therefore, in my game, I learnt the way which Disney design their rides to focus on the background story of the game instead of the game itself. For example, there is a ride called Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which streaks through a haunted gold-mining town aboard a rollicking runaway mine train. The views around the ride were like a gold mining town. There were tools for gold-mining around the railroad and the railroad looked like very old. In order to show riders that it was a haunted gold-mining town, the train always took a sudden turn or speed up quickly to scare people.    I decided to name one of my game, which was inspired by this ride, the same name, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Instead of sitting inside the mine train to travel around the haunted town, mine was for users to use keyboard to control the train to travel around the gridding railroad. I place traps inside several parts of gridding to ""scare"" players, who cannot know where traps are until they get into them. If I know how to use animation, I will show scary pictures when players drive their train to the traps. Unlike the ride in Disney, my players can no longer travel once they encounter a trap because their train may have some problems to keep moving. Also, the main goal in the game is to find the gold. However, as we know, finding gold is really hard. Therefore, players must go to find Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp where also places inside the gridding while players cannot see its exact place until they happen to drive inside the part where lamp is. Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp will show players the map of the gold and when people get to the gold mine, they win. However, there is another limitation of the game. Haunted town is so dangerous during the night. Therefore, players only have 12 hours to finish the task. Train can drive one square in 20 min. Therefore, train can only move 36 times or they will also be caught by traps.    In this game, I want to show audiences I have a background story like rides in Disney World. Players need to find the gold in a haunted gold-mining town. Also, in order to show the relationship with Disney, I use Aladdin\'s Wonderful Lamp as the guide for the players, which is a well known characters in Disney cartoon.    I created another game, called talking with Woody to show the magic power of Disney characters. There are a lot of chances to meet Disney characters in Disney world. On the one hand, travelers, especially small kids, are really excited to meet the characters they watched on TV. I think some kids may believe they take pictures with real Mickey Mouse. On the hand, staffs in Disney who wear the costumes are really tired. It was hot in Orlando last week, but all costumes were very heavy. I was moved by the staffs inside Mickey. They also need to mimic the actions of characters and also need to show kindness and warmness to children. It seems like a really hard job. Therefore, I decide to show this part of Disney in my project as well. I decided to use Woody, a toy all the toys look up to. He is smart, kind and brave like a cowboy should be. He is more than a top, he is friend to everyone enjoying the movie Toy. In order to create an interactive game, I planned to ask players to guide Woody. Players need to call Woody before their instructions. For instance, if players say (actually players are typing) ""Woody, please sit down"", Woody will sit down (actually, there will be another line on the screen showing the same as players import). However, if players are rude and just say ""sit down"" without calling Woody, Woody won\'t act (actually there is just nothing showing up on the screen).  great facilities to provide convenience to everyone   The facilities to satisfy needs for special groups of people, like small kids or disabled people, are well developed. In the past in China, it seemed impossible for parents to take infants and small kids to travel. The road is not flat or wide enough for strollers or wheelchairs. However, in Disney world, everything seemed like well prepared for everyone to use.   There are strollers rentals, and electric conveyance vehicles rentals, which are available to rent throughout Disney world. There are baby care center for mothers to feed, change and nurse little ones. There are locker rentals for storing personal items. There are also hearing disability services which have sign language interpretation to help disabled people to enjoy fantasy world. There are still a lot other convenient services in Disney world. I think the purpose of these services show the pursue of equality among everyone in the world. On the one hand, I am really touched by the availability of these services here. It seems Disney try its best to service everyone who have desire to experience fantasy land. On the other hand, in this way, Disney can attract more travelers in order to make more money in some ways.    Also, in Disney, it seems like a tradition that there are stores at the exit of the famous rides. Somebody may think it is just a strategy to make people shopping a lot. However, I think it also provides some convenience that travelers can buy souvenirs where is memorable. For example, when I finished my trip in Escape Stitch, I entered a store with a lot of kinds of Stitch, like Stitch pillow, Stitch key chain and so on. I really want to buy something in order to remind me the wonderful feelings. Therefore, I showed my opinion inside my game as well. I wrote one part is for shopping. The items are different kinds of Stitch. My codes can act as a robot to help customers to shop in the store.    There are a lot of restaurants in Disney. Maps of Disney are full of restaurants\' name. The greatest things about the food are in Epcot, I experienced different counties in one day. I felt like I was in fast travel in different parts of the world and tasted their special food and snacks while I was on the way. I remembered I was still eating Japanese food when I was in ""Mexico"". It was a great experience. However, there were always a long waiting lines for the all restaurants. People needed to reserve a table a day before their trip and even they had the reservation, they still needed to wait for a long time. I think Disney may need some good ways to fix the problems of waiting for a long time. I have no idea of changing the situation of restaurants, but I think if there are robots to customers to order in fast food restaurant, it may help a lot. Thus, I have another code to customers to order in Plaza Restaurant. If this kind of robots can work in the real life, people can order by themselves and there will be more staffs available to prepare food.    theme park uses interesting ways to teach knowledge of boring topics   Theme part is also a great source of learning knowledge, especially for kids. They use Disney characters, interesting shows, or even games to teach useful things. The ways change the boring knowledge to interesting things, which always attract children\'s attention.    The most amazing one was an interactive game in Epcot\'s Innoventions, called ""where\'s the fire?"", which teaches adults and children basic fire safety in a fun and entertaining way. About every five minutes, the players waiting in line are divided into two groups and move into the home\'s entry. Here, a host will explain the object of the game and lay out the rules. The scenario is this: you are on a mission to discover a number of fire hazards commonly found around the house. To do this, you move from room to room, looking for potential risks. To help in the task, each player is given a special ""safely light"" to help uncover lurking dangers. The rooms are large projection screens. When a hazard is discovered, all persons in the room must shine their safety light on the same spot. when they do, the hazard is rendered harmless and points are assigned. After playing in the game to find the hazardous things in the house, I learned a lot of safety tips. It is much easier to remember the tips I learned during the game than those I learned on textbook or internet. I believe kids will enjoy the games and learn from them as well.    I also tried to show this reflection in my project. Thus, I planned to make a game, called the hall of presidents, which test people\'s knowledge of presidents in USA. However, I failed to achieve the goal of making it an entertaining game instead of a quiz. My game was still like a quiz. However, because it is the only code which can work well inside my big game. I decide to still hold the game for my projects in order to what my original ideas are.   4. technology skill limitations    I feel terribly sorry for my limited skills in CS. It is my first time to learn JAVA this semester. I just begin to learn the core concepts of JAVA this month. When I choose to use java code for this project, I know I will face plentiful limitations and problems. Here I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Johnson, who encouraged me not to give up my ideas.   To be honest, I have no idea of how to change a java code into a real game with animations. I know the background story of the game is more important for English course and pictures are the best way to show the background, but I have no idea to show all these things by JAVA coding. Therefore, I choose to use videos for my presentation. In this way, I can show my animation inside the videos while the code clue of my game is still composed by JAVA coding. Also, video gives me a lot of freedom when choose my contents for presentation. I can explain a lot details of my project clearly through videos.    For example, I found the festival parade in the magic kingdom was great and I wanted to share the experience in my project by showing the pictures or videos. However, because of the technology limitations, I can only show the videos in my presentations. Also, I mistakenly deleted my videos which I shot on my trip Orlando, I can only share others\' parade show......   Also, I want to apologize for the incompleteness of my game. I only dedicated to writing codes for Magic Kingdom, a part of my trip during spring break. Writing codes is a really time consuming task for me. In general, I need to spend more than eight hours to finish one project for my CS assignment this semester. While for this project, the final artifacts are composed of several parts of codes and in the end I need to write the father code in order to take care of my code family for spring break. Due to my limitation in writing codes, I can only finish one part of Disney world. However, I think my code shows all my reflections and perspectives during my trip, even though it looks like it only shows one part of my trip.    The terrible mistake I made is that I found out the most of my codes I wrote had significant errors on Tuesday. I went to CS TA office for help, while the errors were still impossible to fix in order to achieve the goal I planned to get. Consequently, my game have to be separated into several parts. Instead of a big game having others as sub-games inside the big one, my final artifacts are composed by several small games. I need to start them one by one. It may cause some inconvenience for players to map their trip in Disney world.",,10

The Leslie property contained 246.8 acres and was located right on the San Francisco Bay. The land had been used for salt evaporation and had an elevation of exactly sea level. However, the property was diked so that the waters from the bay park were kept out. The city of Mountain View intended to fill the property and use it for a city park.   Ultimately,it fell into the courts to determine a fair market value for the property. Appraisers were hired, but what made the processes difficult was that there were few sales of byland property and none of them corresponded exactly to the characteristics of the Leslie property. The experts involved decided to build a regression model to better understand the factors that might influence market valuation. They collected data on 31 byland properties that were sold during the previous 10 years. In addition to the transaction price for each property, they collected data oina large number of other factors, including size, time of sale, elevation, location, and access to sewers.  A listing of these data, including only those variables deemed relevant for this exercise. A description of the variables is provided below.  Variable name  Description  Price  Sales price in $000 per acre  County  San Mateo=0, Santa Clara =1  Size  Size of the property in acres  Elevation  Average Elevation in foot above sea level  Sewer  Distance (in feet) to nearest sewer connection  Date  Date of sale counting backward from current time (in months)  Flood  Subject to flooding by tidal action =1; otherwise =0  Distance  Distance in miles from Leslie Property (in almost all cases, this is toward San Francisco  Discuss and Answer the following questions:  1. What is the nature of each of the variables? Which variable is dependent variable and what are the independent variables in the model?  2. Check whether the variables require any transformation individually  3. Set up a regression equation, run the model and discuss your results",,6

Incredible!                                        SHREK                          Are you talkin\' to...(he turns around                           and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back                           around and Donkey is right in front                           of him.) Whoa!                                        DONKEY                          Yes. I was talkin\' to you. Can I tell                           you that you that you was great back                           here? Those guards! They thought they                           was all of that. Then you showed up,                           and bam! They was trippin\' over themselves                           like babes in the woods. That really                           made me feel good to see that.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s great. Really.                                       DONKEY                          Man, it\'s good to be free.                                       SHREK                          Now, why don\'t you go celebrate your                           freedom with your own friends? Hmm?                                                                  DONKEY                          But, uh, I don\'t have any friends. And                           I\'m not goin\' out there by myself. Hey,                           wait a minute! I got a great idea! I\'ll                           stick with you. You\'re mean, green,                           fightin\' machine. Together we\'ll scare                           the spit out of anybody that crosses                           us.                  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very                 loudly.                                        DONKEY                          Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you                           don\'t mind me sayin\', if that don\'t                           work, your breath certainly will get                           the job done, \'cause you definitely                           need some Tic Tacs or something, \'cause                           you breath stinks! You almost burned                           the hair outta my nose, just like the                           time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey                           continues to talk, so Shrek removes                           his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten                           berries. I had strong gases leaking                           out of my butt that day.                                        SHREK                          Why are you following me?                                       DONKEY                          I\'ll tell you why. (singing) \'Cause                           I\'m all alone, There\'s no one here beside                           me, My problems have all gone, There\'s                           no one to deride me, But you gotta have                           faith...                                        SHREK                          Stop singing! It\'s no wonder you don\'t                           have any friends.                                        DONKEY                          Wow. Only a true friend would be that                           cruelly honest.                                        SHREK                          Listen, little donkey. Take a look at                           me. What am I?                                        DONKEY                          (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really                           tall?                                        SHREK                          No! I\'m an ogre! You know. ""Grab your                           torch and pitchforks."" Doesn\'t that                           bother you?                                        DONKEY                          Nope.                                       SHREK                          Really?                                       DONKEY                          Really, really.                                       SHREK                          Oh.                                       DONKEY                          Man, I like you. What\'s you name?                                       SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek? Well, you know what I like about                           you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don\'t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me                           thing. I like that. I respect that,                           Shrek. You all right. (They come over                           a hill and you can see Shrek\'s cottage.)                           Whoa! Look at that. Who\'d want to live                           in place like that?                                        SHREK                          That would be my home.                                       DONKEY                          Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.                           You know you are quite a decorator.                           It\'s amazing what you\'ve done with such                           a modest budget. I like that boulder.                           That is a nice boulder. I guess you                           don\'t entertain much, do you?                                        SHREK                          I like my privacy.                                       DONKEY                          You know, I do too. That\'s another thing                           we have in common. Like I hate it when                           you got somebody in your face. You\'ve                           trying to give them a hint, and they                           won\'t leave. There\'s that awkward silence.                           (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, what?                                       DONKEY                          Can I stay with you, please?                                       SHREK                          (sarcastically) Of course!                                       DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Please! I don\'t wanna go back there!                           You don\'t know what it\'s like to be                           considered a freak. (pause while he                           looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.                           But that\'s why we gotta stick together.                           You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!                                                                  SHREK                          Okay! Okay! But one night only.                                       DONKEY                          Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)                                                                  SHREK                          What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto                           a chair.) No! No!                                        DONKEY                          This is gonna be fun! We can stay up                           late, swappin\' manly stories, and in                           the mornin\' I\'m makin\' waffles.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                                       DONKEY                          Where do, uh, I sleep?                                       SHREK                          (irritated) Outside!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, well, I guess that\'s cool. I mean,                           I don\'t know you, and you don\'t know                           me, so I guess outside is best, you                           know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek                           slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do                           like the outdoors. I\'m a donkey. I was                           born outside. I\'ll just be sitting by                           myself outside, I guess, you know. By                           myself, outside. I\'m all alone...there\'s                           no one here beside me...                  SHREK\'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                 Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights                 a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a                 noise. He stands up with a huff.                                        SHREK                          (to Donkey) I thought I told you to                           stay outside.                                        DONKEY                          (from the window) I am outside.                 There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that                 made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns                 and spots 3 blind mice on his table.                                        BLIND MOUSE1                          Well, gents, it\'s a far cry from the                           farm, but what choice do we have?                                                                  BLIND MOUSE2                          It\'s not home, but it\'ll do just fine.                                                                  GORDO                          (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.                                                                  SHREK                          Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes                           and lands on his shoulder.)                                        GORDO                          I found some cheese. (bites Shrek\'s                           ear)                                        SHREK                          Ow!                                       GORDO                          Blah! Awful stuff.                                       BLIND MOUSE1                          Is that you, Gordo?                                       GORDO                          How did you know?                                       SHREK                          Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are                           you doing in my house? (He gets bumped                           from behind and he drops the mice.)                           Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves                           with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,                           no, no. Dead broad off the table.                                                                  DWARF                          Where are we supposed to put her? The                           bed\'s taken.                                        SHREK                          Huh?                 Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.                 The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at                 him.                                        BIG BAD WOLF                          What?                 TIME LAPSE                 Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging                 him to the front door.                                        SHREK                          I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I\'m                           a terrifying ogre! What do I have to                           do get a little privacy? (He opens the                           front door to throw the Wolf out and                           he sees that all the collected Fairy                           Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,                           no. No! No!                  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his                 pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing                 flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.                                                        SHREK                          What are you doing in my swamp? (this                           echoes and everyone falls silent.)                                            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a                 tent.                                        SHREK                          All right, get out of here. All of you,                           move it! Come on! Let\'s go! Hapaya!                           Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more                           dwarves run inside the house) No, no!                           No, no. Not there. Not there. (they                           shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to                           look at Donkey)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, don\'t look at me. I didn\'t invite                           them.                                        PINOCCHIO                          Oh, gosh, no one invited us.                                       SHREK                          What?                                       PINOCCHIO                          We were forced to come here.                                       SHREK                          (flabbergasted) By who?                                       LITTLE PIG                          Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed                           and he...signed an eviction notice.                                                                  SHREK                          (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where                           this Farquaad guy is?                  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, I do. I know where he is.                                       SHREK                          Does anyone else know where to find                           him? Anyone at all?                                        DONKEY                          Me!

Do not get comfortable.                           Your welcome is officially worn out.                           In fact, I\'m gonna see this guy Farquaad                           right now and get you all off my land                           and back where you came from! (Pause.                           Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)                           You! You\'re comin\' with me.                                        DONKEY                          All right, that\'s what I like to hear,                           man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart                           friends, off on a whirlwind big-city                           adventure. I love it!                                        DONKEY                          (singing) On the road again. Sing it                           with me, Shrek. I can\'t wait to get                           on the road again.                                        SHREK                          What did I say about singing?                                       DONKEY                          Can I whistle?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Can I hum it?                                       SHREK                          All right, hum it.                 Donkey begins to hum \'On the Road Again\'.                 DULOC - KITCHEN                 A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He\'s continually                 dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.                                        FARQUAAD                          That\'s enough. He\'s ready to talk.                                            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down                 onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the                 table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes                 up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.                                                        FARQUAAD                          (he picks up the Gingerbread Man\'s legs                           and plays with them) Run, run, run,                           as fast as you can. You can\'t catch                           me. I\'m the gingerbread man.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          You are a monster.                                       FARQUAAD                          I\'m not the monster here. You are. You                           and the rest of that fairy tale trash,                           poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell                           me! Where are the others?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad\'s                           eye.)                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ve tried to be fair to you creatures.                           Now my patience has reached its end!                           Tell me or I\'ll...(he makes as if to                           pull off the Gingerbread Man\'s buttons)                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop                           buttons.                                        FARQUAAD                          All right then. Who\'s hiding them?                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          Okay, I\'ll tell you. Do you know the                           muffin man?                                        FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?                                       GINGERBREAD MAN                          The muffin man.                                       FARQUAAD                          Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives                           on Drury Lane?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Well, she\'s married to the muffin man.

FARQUAAD                          She\'s married to the muffin man.                 The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.                                       HEAD GUARD                          My lord! We found it.                                       FARQUAAD                          Then what are you waiting for? Bring                           it in.                  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.                 They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic                 Mirror.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          (in awe) Ohhhh...

(Farquaad picks                           him up and dumps him into a trash can                           with a lid.) No!                                        FARQUAAD                          Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.                           Is this not the most perfect kingdom                           of them all?

(Thelonius holds up a                           hand mirror and smashes it with his                           fist.) You were saying?                                        MIRROR                          What I mean is you\'re not a king yet.                           But you can become one. All you have                           to do is marry a princess.                                        FARQUAAD                          Go on.                                       MIRROR                          (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back                           and relax, my lord, because it\'s time                           for you to meet today\'s eligible bachelorettes.                           And here they are! Bachelorette number                           one is a mentally abused shut-in from                           a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi                           and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies                           include cooking and cleaning for her                           two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.                           (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette                           number two is a cape-wearing girl from                           the land of fancy. Although she lives                           with seven other men, she\'s not easy.                           Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and                           find out what a live wire she is. Come                           on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows                           picture of Snow White) And last, but                           certainly not last, bachelorette number                           three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded                           castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!                           But don\'t let that cool you off. She\'s                           a loaded pistol who likes pina colads                           and getting caught in the rain. Yours                           for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

She\'s perfect. All I                           have to do is just find someone who                           can go...                                        MIRROR                          But I probably should mention the little                           thing that happens at night.                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ll do it.                                       MIRROR                          Yes, but after sunset...                                       FARQUAAD                          Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona                           my queen, and DuLoc will finally have                           the perfect king! Captain, assemble                           your finest men. We\'re going to have                           a tournament. (smiles evilly)                  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section                 Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking                 lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.                                        DONKEY                          But that\'s it. That\'s it right there.                           That\'s DuLoc. I told ya I\'d find it.                                                                  SHREK                          So, that must be Lord Farquaad\'s castle.                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh-huh. That\'s the place.                                       SHREK                          Do you think maybe he\'s compensating                           for something? (He laughs, but then                           groans as Donkey doesn\'t get the joke.                           He continues walking through the parking                           lot.)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.                                       MAN                          Hurry, darling. We\'re late. Hurry.                                                                  SHREK                          Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing                           a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,                           screams and begins running through the                           rows of rope to get to the front gate                           to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.                           Look, I\'m not gonna eat you. I just                           - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins                           walking straight through the rows. The                           attendant runs into a wall and falls                           down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then                           continue on into DuLoc.)                  DULOC                 They look around but all is quiet.                                       SHREK                          It\'s quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?                                                                  DONKEY                          Hey, look at this!                 Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box                 marked \'Information\'. The music winds up and then the box doors                 open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin                 to sing.                                        WOODEN PEOPLE                          Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town                                            Here we have some rules                 Let us lay them down                 Don\'t make waves, stay in line                 And we\'ll get along fine                 DuLoc is perfect place                 Please keep off of the grass                 Shine your shoes, wipe your... face                 DuLoc is, DuLoc is                 DuLoc is perfect place.                 Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek\'s picture.                                       DONKEY                          Wow! Let\'s do that again! (makes ready                           to run over and pull the lever again)                                                                  SHREK                          (grabs Donkey\'s tail and holds him still)                           No. No. No, no, no! No.                  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.                                       FARQUAAD                          Brave knights. You are the best and                           brightest in all the land. Today one                           of you shall prove himself...                  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena                 Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.                                        SHREK                          All right. You\'re going the right way                           for a smacked bottom.                                        DONKEY                          Sorry about that.                                       FARQUAAD                          That champion shall have the honor -                           - no, no - - the privilege to go forth                           and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona                           from the fiery keep of the dragon. If                           for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,                           the first runner-up will take his place                           and so on and so forth. Some of you                           may die, but it\'s a sacrifice I am willing                           to make. (cheers) Let the tournament                           begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is                           that? It\'s hideous!                                        SHREK                          (turns to look at Donkey and then back                           at Farquaad) Ah, that\'s not very nice.                           It\'s just a donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who                           kills the ogre will be named champion!                           Have it him!                                        MEN                          Get him!                                       SHREK                          Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps                           into a table where there are mugs of                           beer)                                        CROWD                          Go ahead! Get him!                                       SHREK                          (holds up a mug of beer) Can\'t we just                           settle this over a pint?                                        CROWD                          Kill the beast!                                       SHREK                          No? All right then. (drinks the beer)                           Come on!                  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel                 of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the                 other men and wetting the ground. It\'s like mud now. Shrek slides                 past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.                 As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger                 beer barrels. It breaks free of it\'s ropes and begins to roll.                 Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much                 fighting going on here I\'m not going to go into detail. Suffice                 to say that Shrek kicks butt.                                        DONKEY                          Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!                 Shrek comes over and bangs a man\'s head up against Donkeys. Shrek                 gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.                                        SHREK                          Yeah!                 A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time                 and sees him.                                        WOMAN                          The chair! Give him the chair!                 Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men                 are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding                 sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.                                        SHREK                          Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you                           very much! I\'m here till Thursday. Try                           the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)                  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on                 Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Shall I give the order, sir?                                       FARQUAAD                          No, I have a better idea. People of                           DuLoc, I give you our champion!                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FARQUAAD                          Congratulations, ogre. You\'re won the                           honor of embarking on a great and noble                           quest.                                        SHREK                          Quest? I\'m already in a quest, a quest                           to get my swamp back.

Where you dumped those                           fairy tale creatures!                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. All right, ogre. I\'ll make you                           a deal. Go on this quest for me, and                           I\'ll give you your swamp back.                                        SHREK                          Exactly the way it was?                                       FARQUAAD                          Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.                                                                  SHREK                          And the squatters?                                       FARQUAAD                          As good as gone.                                       SHREK                          What kind of quest?                 Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field                 heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.                                        DONKEY                          Let me get this straight. You\'re gonna                           go fight a dragon and rescue a princess                           just so Farquaad will give you back                           a swamp which you only don\'t have because                           he filled it full of freaks in the first                           place. Is that about right?                                        SHREK                          You know, maybe there\'s a good reason                           donkeys shouldn\'t talk.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t get it. Why don\'t you just pull                           some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle                           him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds                           his bones to make your bread, the whole                           ogre trip.                                        SHREK                          Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have                           decapitated an entire village and put                           their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,                           cut open their spleen and drink their                           fluids. Does that sound good to you?                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh, no, not really, no.                                       SHREK                          For your information, there\'s a lot                           more to ogres than people think.

DONKEY                          You know what else everybody likes?                           Parfaits.

SHREK                          You know, I think I preferred your humming.                                                                  DONKEY                          Do you have a tissue or something? I\'m                           making a mess. Just the word parfait                           make me start slobbering.                  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through                 a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying                 to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,                 so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.                  DRAGON\'S KEEP                 Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that\'s supposed to                 house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.                                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?                           You gotta warn somebody before you just                           crack one off. My mouth was open and                           everything.                                        SHREK                          Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you\'d                           be dead. (sniffs) It\'s brimstone. We                           must be getting close.                                        DONKEY                          Yeah, right, brimstone. Don\'t be talking                           about it\'s the brimstone. I know what                           I smell. It wasn\'t no brimstone. It                           didn\'t come off no stone neither.                                            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There                 is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where                 the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very                 foreboding.                                        SHREK                          Sure, it\'s big enough, but look at the                           location. (laughs...then the laugh turns                           into a groan)                                        DONKEY                          Uh, Shrek?

We                           wear our fear right out there on our                           sleeves.                                        SHREK                          Wait a second. Donkeys don\'t have sleeves.                                                                  DONKEY                          You know what I mean.                                       SHREK                          You can\'t tell me you\'re afraid of heights.                                                                  DONKEY                          No, I\'m just a little uncomfortable                           about being on a rickety bridge over                           a boiling like of lava!

Shut ... up.                           Now go over there and see if you can                           find any stairs.                                        DONKEY                          Stairs?

I\'ll find those stairs.                           I\'ll whip their butt too. Those stairs                           won\'t know which way they\'re goin\'.

I\'ve mastered the                           stairs. I wish I had a step right here.                           I\'d step all over it.

SHREK                          Well, at least we know where the princess                           is, but where\'s the...

The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it\'s tail and Shrek                 goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the                 tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying                 on the floor.                                        DONKEY                          Oh! Aah! Aah!                 Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small                 part of the bridge he\'s on.                                        DONKEY                          No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,                           what large teeth you have. (the dragon                           growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.                           I know you probably hear this all time                           from your food, but you must bleach,                           \'cause that is one dazzling smile you                           got there. Do I detect a hint of minty                           freshness? And you know what else? You\'re                           - - You\'re a girl dragon! Oh, sure!                           I mean, of course you\'re a girl dragon.                           You\'re just reeking of feminine beauty.                           (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes                           at him) What\'s the matter with you?                           You got something in your eye? Ohh.                           Oh. Oh. Man, I\'d really love to stay,                           but you know, I\'m, uh...(the dragon                           blows a smoke ring in the shape of a                           heart right at him, and he coughs) I\'m                           an asthmatic, and I don\'t know if it\'d                           work out if you\'re gonna blow smoke                           rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him                           up with her teeth and carries him off)                           No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!                  FIONA\'S ROOM                 Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona                 so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She                 then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off                 the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.                 Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for                 a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders                 and shakes her away.                                        FIONA                          Oh! Oh!                                       SHREK                          Wake up!                                       FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          Are you Princess Fiona?                                       FIONA                          I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s nice. Now let\'s go!                                       FIONA                          But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our                           first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,                           romantic moment?                                        SHREK                          Yeah, sorry, lady. There\'s no time.                                                                  FIONA                          Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should                           sweep me off my feet out yonder window                           and down a rope onto your valiant steed.                                                                  SHREK                          You\'ve had a lot of time to plan this,                           haven\'t you?                                        FIONA                          (smiles) Mm-hmm.                 Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down                 the hallway.                                        FIONA                          But we have to savor this moment! You                           could recite an epic poem for me. A                           ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!                                                                  SHREK                          I don\'t think so.                                       FIONA                          Can I at least know the name of my champion?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       FIONA                          Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds                           out a handkerchief) I pray that you                           take this favor as a token of my gratitude.                                                                  SHREK                          Thanks!                 Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.                                       FIONA                          (surprised)You didn\'t slay the dragon?                                                                  SHREK                          It\'s on my to-do list. Now come on!                           (takes off running and drags Fiona behind                           him.)                                        FIONA                          But this isn\'t right! You were meant                           to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.                           That\'s what all the other knights did.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, right before they burst into flame.                                                                  FIONA                          That\'s not the point. (Shrek suddenly                           stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek                           ignores her and heads for a wooden door                           off to the side.) Wait. Where are you                           going? The exit\'s over there.                                        SHREK                          Well, I have to save my ass.                                       FIONA                          What kind of knight are you?                                       SHREK                          One of a kind. (opens the door into                           the throne room)                                        DONKEY                          (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.                           I believe it\'s healthy to get to know                           someone over a long period of time.                           Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs                           worriedly) (we see him up close and                           from a distance as Shrek sneaks into                           the room) I don\'t want to rush into                           a physical relationship. I\'m not emotionally                           ready for a commitment of, uh, this                           - - Magnitude really is the word I\'m                           looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that                           is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what                           are you doing? Okay, okay. Let\'s just                           back up a little and take this one step                           at a time. We really should get to know                           each other first as friends or pen pals.                           I\'m on the road a lot, but I just love                           receiving cards - - I\'d really love                           to stay, but - - Don\'t do that! That\'s                           my tail! That\'s my personal tail. You\'re                           gonna tear it off. I don\'t give permission                           - - What are you gonna do with that?                           Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.                           No, no, no. No! Oh!                  Shrek grabs a chain that\'s connected to the chandelier and swings                 toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks                 up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.                 He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps                 Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.                 Instead the dragon kisses Shreks\' butt. She opens her eyes and                 roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto                 her head, but it\'s too big and it goes over her head and forms                 a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey                 take off running. Very \'Matrix\' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and                 then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.                                        DONKEY                          Hi, Princess!                                       FIONA                          It talks!                                       SHREK                          Yeah, it\'s getting him to shut up that\'s                           the trick.                  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots                 a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a                 crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His                 eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles                 off and walks lightly.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                 Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.                                                        SHREK                          Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I\'ll                           take care of the dragon.                  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the                 castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping                 chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that                 is still around the dragons neck.                                        SHREK                          (echoing) Run!                 They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot                 pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons                 breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on                 for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They                 are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look                 in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to                 get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the                 dragon back and she\'s unable to get to them. Our gang climbs                 quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a                 sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.                                        FIONA                          (sliding down the \'volcano\' hill) You                           did it! You rescued me! You\'re amazing.                           (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)                           You\'re - - You\'re wonderful. You\'re...                           (turns and sees Shrek fall down the                           hill and bump into Donkey) a little                           unorthodox I\'ll admit. But thy deed                           is great, and thy heart is pure. I am                           eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears                           his throat.) And where would a brave                           knight be without his noble steed?                                                                  DONKEY                          I hope you heard that. She called me                           a noble steed. She think I\'m a steed.                                                                  FIONA                          The battle is won. You may remove your                           helmet, good Sir Knight.                                        SHREK                          Uh, no.                                       FIONA                          Why not?                                       SHREK                          I have helmet hair.                                       FIONA                          Please. I would\'st look upon the face                           of my rescuer.                                        SHREK                          No, no, you wouldn\'t - - \'st.                                       FIONA                          But how will you kiss me?                                       SHREK                          What? (to Donkey) That wasn\'t in the                           job description.                                        DONKEY                          Maybe it\'s a perk.                                       FIONA                          No, it\'s destiny. Oh, you must know                           how it goes. A princess locked in a                           tower and beset by a dragon is rescued                           by a brave knight, and then they share                           true love\'s first kiss.                                        DONKEY                          Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.                           Wait. You think that Shrek is you true                           love?                                        FIONA                          Well, yes.                 Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.                                       DONKEY                          You think Shrek is your true love!                                                                  FIONA                          What is so funny?                                       SHREK                          Let\'s just say I\'m not your type, okay?Fiona:                           Of course, you are. You\'re my rescuer.                           Now - - Now remove your helmet.                                        SHREK                          Look. I really don\'t think this is a                           good idea.                                        FIONA                          Just take off the helmet.                                       SHREK                          I\'m not going to.                                       FIONA                          Take it off.                                       SHREK                          No!                                       FIONA                          Now!                                       SHREK                          Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.                           (takes off his helmet)                                        FIONA                          You- - You\'re a- - an ogre.                                       SHREK                          Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.                                                                  FIONA                          Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is                           all wrong. You\'re not supposed to be                           an ogre.                                        SHREK                          Princess, I was sent to rescue you by                           Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who                           wants to marry you.                                        FIONA                          Then why didn\'t he come rescue me?                                                                  SHREK                          Good question. You should ask him that                           when we get there.                                        FIONA                          But I have to be rescued by my true                           love, not by some ogre and his- - his                           pet.                                        DONKEY                          Well, so much for noble steed.                                       SHREK                          You\'re not making my job any easier.                                                                  FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but your job is not my problem.                           You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he                           wants to rescue me properly, I\'ll be                           waiting for him right here.                                        SHREK                          Hey! I\'m no one\'s messenger boy, all                           right? (ominous) I\'m a delivery boy.                           (he swiftly picks her up and swings                           her over his shoulder like she was a                           sack of potatoes)                                        FIONA                          You wouldn\'t dare. Put me down!                                       SHREK                          Ya comin\', Donkey?                                       DONKEY                          I\'m right behind ya.                                       FIONA                          Put me down, or you will suffer the                           consequences! This is not dignified!                           Put me down!                  WOODS                 A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just                 hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, so here\'s another question. Say                           there\'s a woman that digs you, right,                           but you don\'t really like her that way.                           How do you let her down real easy so                           her feelings aren\'t hurt, but you don\'t                           get burned to a crisp and eaten?                                        FIONA                          You just tell her she\'s not your true                           love. Everyone knows what happens when                           you find your...(Shrek drops her on                           the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to                           DuLoc the better.                                        DONKEY                          You\'re gonna love it there, Princess.                           It\'s beautiful!                                        FIONA                          And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?                           What\'s he like?                                        SHREK                          Let me put it this way, Princess. Men                           of Farquaad\'s stature are in short supply.                           (he and Donkey laugh)                  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off                 the dust and grime.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t know. There are those who think                           little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:                           Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You\'re                           just jealous you can never measure up                           to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, well, maybe you\'re right, Princess.                           But I\'ll let you do the ""measuring""                           when you see him tomorrow.                                        FIONA                          (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?                           It\'ll take that long? Shouldn\'t we stop                           to make camp?                                        SHREK                          No, that\'ll take longer. We can keep                           going.                                        FIONA                          But there\'s robbers in the woods.                                       DONKEY                          Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting                           to sound good.                                        SHREK                          Hey, come on. I\'m scarier than anything                           we\'re going to see in this forest.                                                                  FIONA                          I need to find somewhere to camp now!                                            Both Donkey and Shrek\'s ears lower as they shrink away from her.                                  MOUNTAIN CLIFF                 Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves                 a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.                                        SHREK                          Hey! Over here.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, we can do better than that. I                           don\'t think this is fit for a princess.                                                                  FIONA                          No, no, it\'s perfect. It just needs                           a few homey touches.                                        SHREK                          Homey touches? Like what? (he hears                           a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona                           who has torn the bark off of a tree.)                                                                  FIONA                          A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee                           good night. (goes into the cave and                           puts the bark door up behind her)                                                                  DONKEY                          You want me to read you a bedtime story?                           I will.                                        FIONA                          (os) I said good night!                 Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the                 boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona                 still inside.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, What are you doing?                                       SHREK                          (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,                           come on. I was just kidding.                  LATER THAT NIGHT                 Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring                 up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations                 to Donkey.                                        SHREK                          And, uh, that one, that\'s Throwback,                           the only ogre to ever spit over three                           wheat fields.                                        DONKEY                          Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future                           from these stars?                                        SHREK                          The stars don\'t tell the future, Donkey.                           They tell stories. Look, there\'s Bloodnut,                           the Flatulent. You can guess what he\'s                           famous for.                                        DONKEY                          I know you\'re making this up.                                       SHREK                          No, look. There he is, and there\'s the                           group of hunters running away from his                           stench.                                        DONKEY                          That ain\'t nothin\' but a bunch of little                           dots.                                        SHREK                          You know, Donkey, sometimes things are                           more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.                                                                  DONKEY                          (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what                           we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?                                                                  SHREK                          Our swamp?                                       DONKEY                          You know, when we\'re through rescuing                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          We? Donkey, there\'s no ""we"". There\'s                           no ""our"". There\'s just me and my swamp.                           The first thing I\'m gonna do is build                           a ten-foot wall around my land.                                        DONKEY                          You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real                           deep just now. You know what I think?                           I think this whole wall thing is just                           a way to keep somebody out.                                        SHREK                          No, do ya think?                                       DONKEY                          Are you hidin\' something?                                       SHREK                          Never mind, Donkey.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, this is another one of those onion                           things, isn\'t it?                                        SHREK                          No, this is one of those drop-it and                           leave-it alone things.                                        DONKEY                          Why don\'t you want to talk about it?                                                                  SHREK                          Why do you want to talk about it?                                       DONKEY                          Why are you blocking?                                       SHREK                          I\'m not blocking.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yes, you are.                                       SHREK                          Donkey, I\'m warning you.                                       DONKEY                          Who you trying to keep out?                                       SHREK                          Everyone! Okay?                                       DONKEY                          (pause) Oh, now we\'re gettin\' somewhere.                           (grins)                  At this point Fiona pulls the \'door\' away from the entrance to                 the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.                                        SHREK                          Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and                           walks over to the edge of the cliff                           and sits down)                                        DONKEY                          What\'s your problem? What you got against                           the whole world anyway?                                        SHREK                          Look, I\'m not the one with the problem,                           okay? It\'s the world that seems to have                           a problem with me. People take one look                           at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big,                           stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before                           they even know me. That\'s why I\'m better                           off alone.                                        DONKEY                          You know what? When we met, I didn\'t                           think you was just a big, stupid, ugly                           ogre.                                        SHREK                          Yeah, I know.                                       DONKEY                          So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?                                                                  SHREK                          Well, there\'s, um, Gabby, the Small                           and Annoying.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny                           one, right there. That one there?                                            Fiona puts the door back.                                       SHREK                          That\'s the moon.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, okay.                 DuLoc - Farquaad\'s Bedroom                 The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays                 in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic                 Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,                           show her to me. Show me the princess.                                                                  MIRROR                          Hmph.                 The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Ah. Perfect.                 Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up                 to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly                 at her image in the mirror.                  MORNING                 Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey                 who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes                 across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along                 with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles                 to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too                 big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but                 she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona                 is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still                 sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey\'s talking                 in his sleep.                                        DONKEY                          (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like                           it like that. Come on, baby. I said                           I like it.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)                                       DONKEY                          Huh? What?                                       SHREK                          Wake up.                                       DONKEY                          What? (stretches and yawns)                                       FIONA                          Good morning. Hm, how do you like your                           eggs?                                        DONKEY                          Oh, good morning, Princess!                 Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.                                       SHREK                          What\'s all this about?                                       FIONA                          You know, we kind of got off to a bad                           start yesterday. I wanted to make it                           up to you. I mean, after all, you did                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Uh, thanks.                 Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.                                       FIONA                          Well, eat up. We\'ve got a big day ahead                           of us. (walks off)                  LATER                 They are once again on their way. They are walking through the                 forest. Shrek belches.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek!                                       SHREK                          What? It\'s a compliment. Better out                           than in, I always say. (laughs)                                        DONKEY                          Well, it\'s no way to behave in front                           of a princess.                  Fiona belches                                       FIONA                          Thanks.                                       DONKEY                          She\'s as nasty as you are.                                       SHREK                          (chuckles) You know, you\'re not exactly                           what I expected.                                        FIONA                          Well, maybe you shouldn\'t judge people                           before you get to know them.                  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly                 from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into                 a tree.                                        ROBIN HOOD                          La liberte! Hey!                                       SHREK                          Princess!                                       FIONA                          (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!                           And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses                           up her arm while Fiona pulls back in                           disgust)...beast.                                        SHREK                          Hey! That\'s my princess! Go find you                           own!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Please, monster! Can\'t you see I\'m a                           little busy here?                                        FIONA                          (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don\'t                           know who you think you are!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please                           let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.                           (laughs)                  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out                 from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin\'s theme song.                                        MERRY MEN                          Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          I steal from the rich and give to the                           needy.                                        MERRY MEN                          He takes a wee percentage,                                       ROBIN HOOD                          But I\'m not greedy. I rescue pretty                           damsels, man, I\'m good.                                        MERRY MEN                          What a guy, Monsieur Hood.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          Break it down. I like an honest fight                           and a saucy little maid...                                        MERRY MEN                          What he\'s basically saying is he likes                           to get...                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush                           grabs a lady by the tush. That\'s bad.                                                                  MERRY MEN                          That\'s bad.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          When a beauty\'s with a beast it makes                           me awfully mad.                                        MERRY MEN                          He\'s mad, he\'s really, really mad.                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          I\'ll take my blade and ram it through                           your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys                           \'cause I\'m about to start...                  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and                 knocks Robin Hood unconscious.                                        FIONA                          Man, that was annoying!                 Shrek looks at her in admiration.                                       MERRY MAN                          Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at                           Fiona but she ducks out of the way)                                            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek\'s arms to                 get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.                                  Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and                 then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is                 a very interesting \'Matrix\' moment here when Fiona pauses in                 mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,                 and Fiona begins walking away.                                        FIONA                          Uh, shall we?                                       SHREK                          Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins                           walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,                           whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come                           from?                                        FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          That! Back there. That was amazing!                           Where did you learn that?                                        FIONA                          Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,                           uh, one has to learn these things in                           case there\'s a...(gasps and points)                           there\'s an arrow in your butt!                                        SHREK                          What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you                           look at that? (he goes to pull it out                           but flinches because it\'s tender)                                                                  FIONA                          Oh, no. This is all my fault. I\'m so                           sorry.                                        DONKEY                          (walking up) Why?

DONKEY                          You can\'t do this to me, Shrek. I\'m                           too young for you to die. Keep you legs                           elevated. Turn your head and cough.                           Does anyone know the Heimlich?                                        FIONA                          Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help                           Shrek, run into the woods and find me                           a blue flower with red thorns.                                        DONKEY                          Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I\'m on                           it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don\'t die                           Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay                           away from the light!

FIONA                          (like it\'s obvious) For getting rid                           of Donkey.

Easy with the                           yankin\'.                  As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and                 Shrek keeps dodging her hands.                                        FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but it has to come out.

Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue                 on their way.                  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.                 Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a                 small brook so that Fiona won\'t get wet. Shrek then gets up as                 Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back                 into it\'s upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting                 and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb                 that\'s on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it                 around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins                 eating like it\'s a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.                 Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting                 it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning                 it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek.

FIONA                          I guess I\'ll be dining a little differently                           tomorrow night.

They smiles at each other.                                       SHREK                          Um, Princess?

I used to                           be afraid of the dark, too, until -                           - Hey, no, wait. I\'m still afraid of                           the dark.                  Shrek sighs                                       FIONA                          Good night.                                       SHREK                          Good night.                 Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks                 at Shrek with a new eye.                                        DONKEY                          Ohh!

SHREK                          Yeah. An ogre.                                       DONKEY                          Hey, where you goin\'?                                       SHREK                          To get... move firewood. (sighs)                 Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already                 is.                  TIME LAPSE                 Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is                 nowhere to be seen.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,                           where are you? Princess?                  Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can\'t see her.                                                        DONKEY                          It\'s very spooky in here. I ain\'t playing                           no games.                  Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn\'t                 look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking                 out.                                        DONKEY                          Aah!

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets                 down.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? What happened to you?

OUTSIDE                 Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his                 hand.

He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey                 and Fiona talking.

That\'s why I can\'t                           stay here with Shrek.                  Shrek steps back in shock.

He throws the flower down and walks                 away.                  INSIDE                                       FIONA                          Don\'t you see, Donkey? That\'s just how                           it has to be. It\'s the only way to break                           the spell.                                        DONKEY                          You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.                                                                  FIONA                          No! You can\'t breathe a word.

DONKEY                          What\'s the point of being able to talk                           if you gotta keep secrets?                                        FIONA                          Promise you won\'t tell. Promise!                                       DONKEY                          All right, all right. I won\'t tell him.                           But you should. (goes outside) I just                           know before this is over, I\'m gonna                           need a whole lot of serious therapy.                           Look at my eye twitchin\'.                  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks                 down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back                 inside the windmill.                  MORNING                 Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still                 awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.                                        FIONA                          I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,                           I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly                           runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!                           Shrek, there\'s something I want...(she                           looks and sees the rising sun, and as                           the sun crests the sky she turns back                           into a human.)                  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards                 her.                                        FIONA                          Shrek. Are you all right?                                       SHREK                          Perfect! Never been better.                                       FIONA                          I - - I don\'t - - There\'s something                           I have to tell you.                                        SHREK                          You don\'t have to tell me anything,                           Princess. I heard enough last night.                                                                  FIONA                          You heard what I said?                                       SHREK                          Every word.                                       FIONA                          I thought you\'d understand.                                       SHREK                          Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who                           could love a hideous, ugly beast?""                                                                  FIONA                          But I thought that wouldn\'t matter to                           you.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at                           him in shock. He looks past her and                           spots a group approaching.) Ah, right                           on time. Princess, I\'ve brought you                           a little something.                  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal                 sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he\'s only                 like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers                 march by.                                        DONKEY                          What\'d I miss? What\'d I miss? (spots                           the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?                           Couldn\'t have been the donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona.                                       SHREK                          As promised. Now hand it over.                                       FARQUAAD                          Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece                           of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared                           out, as agreed. Take it and go before                           I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)                           Forgive me, Princess, for startling                           you, but you startled me, for I have                           never seen such a radiant beauty before.                           I\'m Lord Farquaad.                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad                           snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,                           for I was just saying a short... (Watches                           as Farquaad is lifted off his horse                           and set down in front of her. He comes                           to her waist.) farewell.                                        FARQUAAD                          Oh, that is so sweet. You don\'t have                           to waste good manners on the ogre. It\'s                           not like it has feelings.                                        FIONA                          No, you\'re right. It doesn\'t.                 Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless                           Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.                           Will you be the perfect bride for the                           perfect groom?                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would                           make - -                                        FARQUAAD                          (interrupting) Excellent! I\'ll start                           the plans, for tomorrow we wed!                                        FIONA                          No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let\'s get                           married today before the sun sets.                                                                  FARQUAAD                          Oh, anxious, are you? You\'re right.                           The sooner, the better. There\'s so much                           to do! There\'s the caterer, the cake,                           the band, the guest list. Captain, round                           up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona                           on the back of his horse)                                        FIONA                          Fare-thee-well, ogre.                 Farquaad\'s whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches                 them go.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, what are you doing? You\'re letting                           her get away.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? So what?                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, there\'s something about her you                           don\'t know. Look, I talked to her last                           night, She\'s - -                                        SHREK                          I know you talked to her last night.                           You\'re great pals, aren\'t ya? Now, if                           you two are such good friends, why don\'t                           you follow her home?

Fiona                 being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running                 into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner                 alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.                  SHREK\'S HOME                 Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes                 outside to investigate.                                        SHREK                          Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues                           with what he\'s doing.) What are you                           doing?                                        DONKEY                          I would think, of all people, you would                           recognize a wall when you see one.                                                                  SHREK                          Well, yeah. But the wall\'s supposed                           to go around my swamp, not through it.

I get half the                           booty. Now hand me that big old rock,                           the one that looks like your head.

(whistles)                  Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so                 they can climb on.

DULOC - CHURCH                 Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there.

(to Shrek)                           I wanted to show you before.                  She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self.

DONKEY                          Go ahead, Shrek.                                       SHREK                          Uh, Fiona?

Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes                 \'Awwww\' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.                                                        CONGREGATION                          Aawww!                 Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She\'s lifted                 up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around                 her.                                        WHISPERS                          ""Until you find true love\'s first kiss                           and then take love\'s true form. Take                           love\'s true form. Take love\'s true form.""                                            Suddenly Fiona\'s eyes open wide. She\'s consumed by the spell                 and then is slowly lowered to the ground.                                        SHREK                          (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona.

But I don\'t understand. I\'m supposed                           to be beautiful.                                        SHREK                          But you ARE beautiful.                 They smile at each other.                                       DONKEY                          (chuckles) I was hoping this would be                           a happy ending.                  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...                 THE SWAMP                 ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. \'I\'m                 a Believer\' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek                 and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting                 carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet                 which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end                 up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet                 instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now                 has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona                 walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over                 singing the song.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          God bless us, every one.                                       DONKEY                          (as he\'s done singing and we fade to                           black) Oh, that\'s funny. Oh. Oh. I can\'t                           breathe.

0,https://github.com/CGCL-codes/ShareRender.git,"ShareRender is a cloud gaming system that enables fine-grained resource sharing at the frame-level.  Existing cloud gaming systems suffer from low GPU utilization in the virtualized environment. Moreover, GPU resources are scheduled in units of virtual machines (VMs) and this kind of coarse-grained scheduling at the VM-level fails to fully exploit GPU processing capacity. ShareRender offloads graphics workloads within VMs directly to GPUs, bypassing GPU virtualization. For each game running in a VM, ShareRender starts a graphics wrapper to intercept frame rendering requests and assign them to render agents responsible for frame rendering on GPUs. Thanks to the flexible workload assignment among multiple render agents, ShareRender enables fine-grained resource sharing at the frame-level to significantly improve GPU utilization.  If you want to know more about ShareRender, please refer to our paper in Multimedia 2017.

0,https://github.com/SOYJUN/FTP-implement-based-on-UDP.git,"The aim of this assignment is to have you do UDP socket client / server programming with a focus on two broad aspects :  Setting up the exchange between the client and server in a secure way despite the lack of a formal connection (as in TCP) between the two, so that ‘outsider’ UDP datagrams (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) cannot intrude on the communication.  Introducing application-layer protocol data-transmission reliability, flow control and congestion control in the client and server using TCP-like ARQ sliding window mechanisms. The second item above is much more of a challenge to implement than the first, though neither is particularly trivial. But they are not tightly interdependent; each can be worked on separately at first and then integrated together at a later stage.  Apart from the material in Chapters 8, 14 & 22 (especially Sections 22.5 - 22.7), and the experience you gained from the preceding assignment, you will also need to refer to the following :  ioctl function (Chapter 17).  get_ifi_info function (Section 17.6, Chapter 17). This function will be used by the server code to discover its node’s network interfaces so that it can bind all its interface IP addresses (see Section 22.6).  ‘Race’ conditions (Section 20.5, Chapter 20) You also need a thorough understanding of how the TCP protocol implements reliable data transfer, flow control and congestion control. Chapters 17- 24 of   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1  by W. Richard Stevens gives a good overview of TCP. Though somewhat dated for some things (it was published in 1994), it remains, overall, a good basic reference.  Overview  This assignment asks you to implement a primitive file transfer protocol for Unix platforms, based on UDP, and with TCP-like reliability added to the transfer operation using timeouts and sliding-window mechanisms, and implementing flow and congestion control. The server is a concurrent server which can handle multiple clients simultaneously. A client gives the server the name of a file. The server forks off a child which reads directly from the file and transfers the contents over to the client using UDP datagrams. The client prints out the file contents as they come in, in order, with nothing missing and with no duplication of content, directly on to stdout (via the receiver sliding window, of course, but with no other intermediate buffering). The file to be transferred can be of arbitrary length, but its contents are always straightforward ascii text.  As an aside let me mention that assuming the file contents ascii is not as restrictive as it sounds. We can always pretend, for example, that binary files are base64 encoded (“ASCII armor”). A real file transfer protocol would, of course, have to worry about transferring files between heterogeneous platforms with different file structure conventions and semantics. The sender would first have to transform the file into a platform-independent, protocol-defined, format (using, say, ASN.1, or some such standard), and the receiver would have to transform the received file into its platform’s native file format. This kind of thing can be fairly time consuming, and is certainly very tedious, to implement, with little educational value - it is not part of this assignment.  Arguments for the server  You should provide the server with an input file server.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  Well-known port number for server. Maximum sending sliding-window size (in datagram units). You will not be handing in your server.in file. We shall create our own when we come to test your code. So it is important that you stick strictly to the file name and content conventions specified above. The same applies to the client.in input file below.  Arguments for the client  The client is to be provided with an input file client.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  IP address of server (not the hostname). Well-known port number of server. filename to be transferred. Receiving sliding-window size (in datagram units). Random generator seed value. Probability p of datagram loss. This should be a real number in the range [ 0.0 , 1.0 ]  (value 0.0 means no loss occurs; value 1.0 means all datagrams all lost). The mean µ, in milliseconds, for an exponential distribution controlling the rate at which the client reads received datagram payloads from its receive buffer. Operation  Server starts up and reads its arguments from file server.in.  As we shall see, when a client communicates with the server, the server will want to know what IP address that client is using to identify the server (i.e. , the destination IP address in the incoming datagram). Normally, this can be done relatively straightforwardly using the IP_RECVDESTADDR socket option, and picking up the information using the ancillary data (‘control information’) capability of the recvmsg function. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support the IP_RECVDESTADDR option (nor, incidentally, does it support the msg_flags option in msghdr - see p.390). This considerably complicates things.  In the absence of IP_RECVDESTADDR, what the server has to do as part of its initialization phase is to bind each IP address it has (and, simultaneously, its well-known port number, which it has read in from server.in) to a separate UDP socket. The code in Section 22.6, which uses the get_ifi_info function, shows you how to do that. However, there are important differences between that code and the version you want to implement. The code of Section 22.6 binds the IP addresses and forks off a child for each address that is bound to. We do not want to do that. Instead you should have an array of socket descriptors. For each IP address, create a new socket and bind the address (and well-known port number) to the socket without forking off child processes. Creating child processes comes later, when clients arrive.  The code of Section 22.6 also attempts to bind broadcast addresses. We do not want to do this. It binds a wildcard IP address, which we certainly do not want to do either. We should bind strictly only unicast addresses (including the loopback address).  The get_ifi_info function (which the code in Section 22.6 uses) has to be modified so that it also gets the network masks for the IP addresses of the node, and adds these to the information stored in the linked list of ifi_info structures (see Figure 17.5, p.471) it produces. As you go binding each IP address to a distinct socket, it will be useful for later processing to build your own array of structures, where a structure element records the following information for each socket :  sockfd IP address bound to the socket network mask for the IP address subnet address (obtained by doing a bit-wise and between the IP address and its network mask)  Report, in a ReadMe file which you hand in with your code, on the modifications you had to introduce to ensure that only unicast addresses are bound, and on your implementation of the array of structures described above.  You should print out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted in dotted decimal notation, the IP address, network mask, and subnet address for each socket in your array of structures (you do not need to print the sockfd).  The server now uses select to monitor the sockets it has created for incoming datagrams. When it returns from select, it must use recvfrom or recvmsg to read the incoming datagram (see 6. below).  When a client starts, it first reads its arguments from the file client.in.  The client checks if the server host is ‘local’ to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the server is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option). It determines if the server host is ‘local’ as follows. The first thing the client should do is to use the modified get_ifi_info function to obtain all of its IP addresses and associated network masks.  Print out on stdout, in dotted decimal notation and with an appropriate message, the IP addresses and network masks obtained.  In the following, IPserver designates the IP address the client will use to identify the server, and IPclient designates the IP address the client will choose to identify itself.  The client checks whether the server is on the same host. If so, it should use the loopback address 127.0.0.1 for the server (i.e. , IPserver = 127.0.0.1). IPclient should also be set to the loopback address.  Otherwise it proceeds as follows:  IPserver is set to the IP address for the server in the client.in file. Given IPserver and the (unicast) IP addresses and network masks for the client returned by get_ifi_info in the linked list of ifi_info structures, you should be able to figure out if the server node is ‘local’ or not. This will be discussed in class; but let me just remind you here that you should use ‘longest prefix matching’ where applicable.  If there are multiple client addresses, and the server host is ‘local’, the client chooses an IP address for itself, IPclient, which matches up as ‘local’ according to your examination above. If the server host is not ‘local’, then IPclient can be chosen arbitrarily.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the server host is ‘local’ or not, as well as the IPclient and IPserver addresses selected.  Note that this manner of determining whether the server is local or not is somewhat clumsy and ‘over-engineered’, and, as such, should be viewed more in the nature of a pedagogical exercise. Ideally, we would like to look up the server IP address(es) in the routing table (see Section 18.3). This requires that a routing socket be created, for which we need superuser privilege. Alternatively, we might want to dump out the routing table, using the sysctl function for example (see Section 18.4), and examine it directly. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support sysctl.   Furthermore, note that there is a slight problem with the address 130.245.1.123/24 assigned to compserv3 (see rightmost column of file hosts, and note that this particular compserv3 address “overlaps” with the 130.245.1.x/28 addresses in that same column assigned to compserv1, compserv2 & comserv4). In particular, if the client is running on compserv3 and the server on any of the other three compservs, and if that server node is also being identified to the client by its /28 (rather than its /24) address, then the client will get a “false positive” when it tests as to whether the server node is local or not. In other words, the client will deem the server node to be local, whereas in fact it should not be considered local. Because of this, it is perhaps best simply not to use compserv3 to run the client (but it is o.k. to use it to run the server).   Finally, using MSG_DONTROUTE where possible would seem to gain us efficiency, in as much as the kernel does not need to consult the routing table for every datagram sent. But, in fact, that is not so. Recall that one effect of connect with UDP sockets is that routing information is obtained by the kernel at the time the connect is issued. That information is cached and used for subsequent sends from the connected socket (see p.255).  The client now creates a UDP socket and calls bind on IPclient, with 0 as the port number. This will cause the kernel to bind an ephemeral port to the socket.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPclient and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client connects its socket to IPserver and the well-known port number of the server.  After the connect, use the getpeername function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the well-known port number of the server, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client sends a datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer. This send needs to be backed up by a timeout in case the datagram is lost.  Note that the incoming datagram from the client will be delivered to the server at the socket to which the destination IP address that the datagram is carrying has been bound. Thus, the server can obtain that address (it is, of course, IPserver) and thereby achieve what IP_RECVDESTADDR would have given us had it been available.  Furthermore, the server process can obtain the IP address (this will, of course, be IPclient) and ephemeral port number of the client through the recvfrom or recvmsg functions.  The server forks off a child process to handle the client. The server parent process goes back to the select to listen for new clients. Hereafter, and unless otherwise stated, whenever we refer to the ‘server’, we mean the server child process handling the client’s file transfer, not the server parent process.  Typically, the first thing the server child would be expected to do is to close all sockets it ‘inherits’ from its parent. However, this is not the case with us. The server child does indeed close the sockets it inherited, but not the socket on which the client request arrived. It leaves that socket open for now. Call this socket the ‘listening’ socket.  The server (child) then checks if the client host is local to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the client is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option).  If IPserver (obtained in 5. above) is the loopback address, then we are done. Otherwise, the server has to proceed with the following step.  Use the array of structures you built in 1. above, together with the addresses IPserver and IPclient to determine if the client is ‘local’.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the client host is ‘local’ or not. The server (child) creates a UDP socket to handle file transfer to the client. Call this socket the ‘connection’ socket. It binds the socket to IPserver, with port number 0 so that its kernel assigns an ephemeral port.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The server then connects this ‘connection’ socket to the client’s IPclient and ephemeral port number.  The server now sends the client a datagram, in which it passes it the ephemeral port number of its ‘connection’ socket as the data payload of the datagram. This datagram is sent using the ‘listening’ socket inherited from its parent, otherwise the client (whose socket is connected to the server’s ‘listening’ socket at the latter’s well-known port number) will reject it. This datagram must be backed up by the ARQ mechanism, and retransmitted in the event of loss.  Note that if this datagram is indeed lost, the client might well time out and retransmit its original request message (the one carrying the file name). In this event, you must somehow ensure that the parent server does not mistake this retransmitted request for a new client coming in, and spawn off yet another child to handle it. How do you do that? It is potentially more involved than it might seem. I will be discussing this in class, as well as ‘race’ conditions that could potentially arise, depending on how you code the mechanisms I present.  When the client receives the datagram carrying the ephemeral port number of the server’s ‘connection’ socket, it reconnects its socket to the server’s ‘connection’ socket, using IPserver and the ephemeral port number received in the datagram (see p.254). It now uses this reconnected socket to send the server an acknowledgment. Note that this implies that, in the event of the server timing out, it should retransmit two copies of its ‘ephemeral port number’ message, one on its ‘listening’ socket and the other on its ‘connection’ socket (why?).  When the server receives the acknowledgment, it closes the ‘listening’ socket it inherited from its parent. The server can now commence the file transfer through its ‘connection’ socket.  The net effect of all these binds and connects at server and client is that no ‘outsider’ UDP datagram (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) can now intrude on the communication between server and client.  Starting with the first datagram sent out, the client behaves as follows.  Whenever a datagram arrives, or an ACK is about to be sent out (or, indeed, the initial datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer), the client uses some random number generator function random() (initialized by the client.in argument value seed) to decide with probability p (another client.in argument value) if the datagram or ACK should be discarded by way of simulating transmission loss across the network. (I will briefly discuss in class how you do this.) Adding reliability to UDP  The mechanisms you are to implement are based on TCP Reno. These include :  Reliable data transmission using ARQ sliding-windows, with Fast Retransmit. Flow control via receiver window advertisements. Congestion control that implements : SlowStart Congestion Avoidance (‘Additive-Increase/Multiplicative Decrease’ – AIMD) Fast Recovery (but without the window-inflation aspect of Fast Recovery) Only some, and by no means all, of the details for these are covered below. The rest will be presented in class, especially those concerning flow control and TCP Reno’s congestion control mechanisms in general :  Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery.  Implement a timeout mechanism on the sender (server) side. This is available to you from Stevens, Section 22.5 . Note, however, that you will need to modify the basic driving mechanism of Figure 22.7 appropriately since the situation at the sender side is not a repetitive cycle of send-receive, but rather a straightforward progression of send-send-send-send- . . . . . . . . . . .  Also, modify the RTT and RTO mechanisms of Section 22.5 as specified below. I will be discussing the details of these modifications and the reasons for them in class.  Modify function rtt_stop (Fig. 22.13) so that it uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point. This will entail your also having to modify some of the variable and function parameter declarations throughout Section 22.5 from float to int, as appropriate.  In the unprrt.h header file (Fig. 22.10) set :           RTT_RXTMIN   to 1000 msec.   (1 sec. instead of the current value   3 sec.)           RTT_RXTMAX  to 3000 msec.   (3 sec. instead of the current value 60 sec.)           RTT_MAXNREXMT  to 12        (instead of the current value 3)  In function rtt_timeout (Fig. 22.14), after doubling the RTO in line 86, pass its value through the function rtt_minmax of Fig. 22.11 (somewhat along the lines of what is done in line 77 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Finally, note that with the modification to integer calculation of the smoothed RTT and its variation, and given the small RTT values you will experience on the cs / sbpub network, these calculations should probably now be done on a millisecond or even microsecond scale (rather than in seconds, as is the case with Stevens’ code). Otherwise, small measured RTTs could show up as 0 on a scale of seconds, yielding a negative result when we subtract the smoothed RTT from the measured RTT (line 72 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Report the details of your modifications to the code of Section 22.5 in the ReadMe file which you hand in with your code.  We need to have a sender sliding window mechanism for the retransmission of lost datagrams; and a receiver sliding window in order to ensure correct sequencing of received file contents, and some measure of flow control. You should implement something based on TCP Reno’s mechanisms, with cumulative acknowledgments, receiver window advertisements, and a congestion control mechanism I will explain in detail in class.  For a reference on TCP’s mechanisms generally, see W. Richard Stevens,   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 , especially Sections 20.2 - 20.4  of  Chapter 20 ,  and Sections 21.1 - 21.8  of  Chapter 21 .  Bear in mind that our sequence numbers should count datagrams, not bytes as in TCP. Remember that the sender and receiver window sizes have to be set according to the argument values in client.in and server.in, respectively. Whenever the sender window becomes full and so ‘locks’, the server should print out a message to that effect on stdout. Similarly, whenever the receiver window ‘locks’, the client should print out a message on stdout.  Be aware of the potential for deadlock when the receiver window ‘locks’. This situation is handled by having the receiver process send a duplicate ACK which acts as a window update when its window opens again (see  Figure 20.3  and the discussion about it in TCP/IP Illustrated). However, this is not enough, because ACKs are not backed up by a timeout mechanism in the event they are lost. So we will also need to implement a persist timer driving window probes in the sender process (see  Sections 22.1 & 22.2  in Chapter 22 of TCP/IP Illustrated). Note that you do not have to worry about the Silly Window Syndrome discussed in Section 22.3 of TCP/IP Illustrated since the receiver process consumes ‘full sized’ 512-byte messages from the receiver buffer (see 3. below).  Report on the details of the ARQ mechanism you implemented in the ReadMe file you hand in. Indeed, you should report on all the TCP mechanisms you implemented in the ReadMe file, both the ones discussed here, and the ones I will be discussing in class.  Make your datagram payload a fixed 512 bytes, inclusive of the file transfer protocol header (which must, at the very least, carry: the sequence number of the datagram; ACKs; and advertised window notifications).  The client reads the file contents in its receive buffer and prints them out on stdout using a separate thread. This thread sits in a repetitive loop till all the file contents have been printed out, doing the following.  It samples from an exponential distribution with mean µ milliseconds (read from the client.in file), sleeps for that number of milliseconds; wakes up to read and print all in-order file contents available in the receive buffer at that point; samples again from the exponential distribution; sleeps; and so on.  The formula     -1 × µ × ln( random( ) ) ,    where ln is the natural logarithm, yields variates from an exponential distribution with mean µ, based on the uniformly-distributed variates over  ( 0 , 1 )  returned by random().  Note that you will need to implement some sort of mutual exclusion/semaphore mechanism on the client side so that the thread that sleeps and wakes up to consume from the receive buffer is not updating the state variables of the buffer at the same time as the main thread reading from the socket and depositing into the buffer is doing the same. Furthermore, we need to ensure that the main thread does not effectively monopolize the semaphore (and thus lock out for prolonged periods of time) the sleeping thread when the latter wakes up. See the textbook, Section 26.7, ‘Mutexes: Mutual Exclusion’,  pp.697-701. You might also find Section 26.8, ‘Condition Variables’,  pp.701-705, useful.  You will need to devise some way by which the sender can notify the receiver when it has sent the last datagram of the file transfer, without the receiver mistaking that EOF marker as part of the file contents. (Also, note that the last data segment could be a “short” segment of less than 512 bytes – your client needs to be able to handle this correctly somehow.) When the sender receives an ACK for the last datagram of the transfer, the (child) server terminates. The parent server has to take care of cleaning up zombie children.  Note that if we want a clean closing, the client process cannot simply terminate when the receiver ACKs the last datagram. This ACK could be lost, which would leave the (child) server process ‘hanging’, timing out, and retransmitting the last datagram. TCP attempts to deal with this problem by means of the TIME_WAIT state. You should have your receiver process behave similarly, sticking around in something akin to a TIME_WAIT state in case in case it needs to retransmit the ACK.  In the ReadMe file you hand in, report on how you dealt with the issues raised here: sender notifying receiver of the last datagram, clean closing, and so on. Output  Some of the output required from your program has been described in the section Operation above. I expect you to provide further output – clear, well-structured, well-laid-out, concise but sufficient and helpful – in the client and server windows by means of which we can trace the correct evolution of your TCP’s behaviour in all its intricacies :  information (e.g., sequence number) on datagrams and acks sent and dropped, window advertisements, datagram retransmissions (and why :  dup acks or RTO); entering/exiting Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance, ssthresh and cwnd values; sender and receiver windows locking/unlocking; etc., etc. . . .  .  The onus is on you to convince us that the TCP mechanisms you implemented are working correctly. Too many students do not put sufficient thought, creative imagination, time or effort into this. It is not the TA’s nor my responsibility to sit staring at an essentially blank screen, trying to summon up our paranormal psychology skills to figure out if your TCP implementation is really working correctly in all its very intricate aspects, simply because the transferred file seems to be printing o.k. in the client window. Nor is it our responsibility to strain our eyes and our patience wading through a mountain of obscure, ill-structured, hyper-messy, debugging-style output because, for example, your effort-conserving concept of what is ‘suitable’ is to dump your debugging output on us, relevant, irrelevant, and everything in between.",,36

Existing cloud gaming systems suffer from low GPU utilization in the virtualized environment. Moreover, GPU resources are scheduled in units of virtual machines (VMs) and this kind of coarse-grained scheduling at the VM-level fails to fully exploit GPU processing capacity. ShareRender offloads graphics workloads within VMs directly to GPUs, bypassing GPU virtualization. For each game running in a VM, ShareRender starts a graphics wrapper to intercept frame rendering requests and assign them to render agents responsible for frame rendering on GPUs. Thanks to the flexible workload assignment among multiple render agents, ShareRender enables fine-grained resource sharing at the frame-level to significantly improve GPU utilization.

This is a game to map my experience in Disney World, in Orlando during this spring break.   However, because of my limited skills in computer science, I really have no idea how to simplify the process to run the game. Sorry for the inconvenience.   In order to run the game, you may need to install JAVA. I hope the following links will help you. \xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk\u2028\xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs1331/guides/install-java.html  My main file is called Disney. You can call Disney in console to start the game. However, I failed to putting all the things inside Disney file. Therefore, you may also need to call AdventureLand, MainStreet, and FrontierLand to start other three games.   I hope this will help you. Sorry again for the inconvenience.     1. the structure of my project   My project only focused on my trip in Magic Kingdom, one part of Disney world in Orlando. It is a game which guides players to choose from six sub-games, which match six sections of the park, Main Street U.S.A, Tomorrowland, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Liberty Square. I chose one of the rides I took in each section which, from my perspective, shows what I found interesting in Disney world. I changed what I experienced in the park into a small computer game. I want to share my experience with others while they play my games. In the following part of self reflection, I explain the background, rules and other things about each game. For convenience of matching them, I use different color to mark different parts. I hope it will help readers a little bit when they are lost in my disordered reflections.   1. the hall of presidents - Liberty Square   2. Festivall parade - Fantasyland (I explain this one in the part of technology skill limitations)   3. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad - Frontierland   4.talking with Woody- Adventureland    5. Stitch Store - Tomorrowland      6. lunch time - Main Street USA      3. my reflection of the trip in Disney World  from dream to reality    When I exited Disney resort, I found a sign along the street welcomed people back to real world. Actually, when I was in Orlando, I couldn\'t believe as an adult, people can mess up fantasy world in the theme parks and the real world. Nevertheless, I felt I was still in fantasy world, when I dreamed twice that I fought for the key to open the door of future. As is known to all, while sleeping, people always dream about what people thinks in the daytime. Therefore, my dream shows that my mind still stayed in the world with Mickey and Donald.    I believe that it is experiencing fantasy world which is the source of the greatest happiness people get from theme park. On the one hand, everybody has pressure in real life especially for adults. They can get out of pressure for a day trip in theme park. They can experience different lives here with cartoon characters. On the other hand, sometimes, it is a really hard task to fulfill some dreams, such as being a princess. However, in Disney world, you can dress up the same as Snow White, waiting for your prince; you can go to space by rocket; you can also travel all over the world in one day and enjoy the food of each country. These are all the magic of theme parks.    Therefore, in my game, I learnt the way which Disney design their rides to focus on the background story of the game instead of the game itself. For example, there is a ride called Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which streaks through a haunted gold-mining town aboard a rollicking runaway mine train. The views around the ride were like a gold mining town. There were tools for gold-mining around the railroad and the railroad looked like very old. In order to show riders that it was a haunted gold-mining town, the train always took a sudden turn or speed up quickly to scare people.    I decided to name one of my game, which was inspired by this ride, the same name, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Instead of sitting inside the mine train to travel around the haunted town, mine was for users to use keyboard to control the train to travel around the gridding railroad. I place traps inside several parts of gridding to ""scare"" players, who cannot know where traps are until they get into them. If I know how to use animation, I will show scary pictures when players drive their train to the traps. Unlike the ride in Disney, my players can no longer travel once they encounter a trap because their train may have some problems to keep moving. Also, the main goal in the game is to find the gold. However, as we know, finding gold is really hard. Therefore, players must go to find Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp where also places inside the gridding while players cannot see its exact place until they happen to drive inside the part where lamp is. Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp will show players the map of the gold and when people get to the gold mine, they win. However, there is another limitation of the game. Haunted town is so dangerous during the night. Therefore, players only have 12 hours to finish the task. Train can drive one square in 20 min. Therefore, train can only move 36 times or they will also be caught by traps.    In this game, I want to show audiences I have a background story like rides in Disney World. Players need to find the gold in a haunted gold-mining town. Also, in order to show the relationship with Disney, I use Aladdin\'s Wonderful Lamp as the guide for the players, which is a well known characters in Disney cartoon.    I created another game, called talking with Woody to show the magic power of Disney characters. There are a lot of chances to meet Disney characters in Disney world. On the one hand, travelers, especially small kids, are really excited to meet the characters they watched on TV. I think some kids may believe they take pictures with real Mickey Mouse. On the hand, staffs in Disney who wear the costumes are really tired. It was hot in Orlando last week, but all costumes were very heavy. I was moved by the staffs inside Mickey. They also need to mimic the actions of characters and also need to show kindness and warmness to children. It seems like a really hard job. Therefore, I decide to show this part of Disney in my project as well. I decided to use Woody, a toy all the toys look up to. He is smart, kind and brave like a cowboy should be. He is more than a top, he is friend to everyone enjoying the movie Toy. In order to create an interactive game, I planned to ask players to guide Woody. Players need to call Woody before their instructions. For instance, if players say (actually players are typing) ""Woody, please sit down"", Woody will sit down (actually, there will be another line on the screen showing the same as players import). However, if players are rude and just say ""sit down"" without calling Woody, Woody won\'t act (actually there is just nothing showing up on the screen).  great facilities to provide convenience to everyone   The facilities to satisfy needs for special groups of people, like small kids or disabled people, are well developed. In the past in China, it seemed impossible for parents to take infants and small kids to travel. The road is not flat or wide enough for strollers or wheelchairs. However, in Disney world, everything seemed like well prepared for everyone to use.   There are strollers rentals, and electric conveyance vehicles rentals, which are available to rent throughout Disney world. There are baby care center for mothers to feed, change and nurse little ones. There are locker rentals for storing personal items. There are also hearing disability services which have sign language interpretation to help disabled people to enjoy fantasy world. There are still a lot other convenient services in Disney world. I think the purpose of these services show the pursue of equality among everyone in the world. On the one hand, I am really touched by the availability of these services here. It seems Disney try its best to service everyone who have desire to experience fantasy land. On the other hand, in this way, Disney can attract more travelers in order to make more money in some ways.    Also, in Disney, it seems like a tradition that there are stores at the exit of the famous rides. Somebody may think it is just a strategy to make people shopping a lot. However, I think it also provides some convenience that travelers can buy souvenirs where is memorable. For example, when I finished my trip in Escape Stitch, I entered a store with a lot of kinds of Stitch, like Stitch pillow, Stitch key chain and so on. I really want to buy something in order to remind me the wonderful feelings. Therefore, I showed my opinion inside my game as well. I wrote one part is for shopping. The items are different kinds of Stitch. My codes can act as a robot to help customers to shop in the store.    There are a lot of restaurants in Disney. Maps of Disney are full of restaurants\' name. The greatest things about the food are in Epcot, I experienced different counties in one day. I felt like I was in fast travel in different parts of the world and tasted their special food and snacks while I was on the way. I remembered I was still eating Japanese food when I was in ""Mexico"". It was a great experience. However, there were always a long waiting lines for the all restaurants. People needed to reserve a table a day before their trip and even they had the reservation, they still needed to wait for a long time. I think Disney may need some good ways to fix the problems of waiting for a long time. I have no idea of changing the situation of restaurants, but I think if there are robots to customers to order in fast food restaurant, it may help a lot. Thus, I have another code to customers to order in Plaza Restaurant. If this kind of robots can work in the real life, people can order by themselves and there will be more staffs available to prepare food.    theme park uses interesting ways to teach knowledge of boring topics   Theme part is also a great source of learning knowledge, especially for kids. They use Disney characters, interesting shows, or even games to teach useful things. The ways change the boring knowledge to interesting things, which always attract children\'s attention.    The most amazing one was an interactive game in Epcot\'s Innoventions, called ""where\'s the fire?"", which teaches adults and children basic fire safety in a fun and entertaining way. About every five minutes, the players waiting in line are divided into two groups and move into the home\'s entry. Here, a host will explain the object of the game and lay out the rules. The scenario is this: you are on a mission to discover a number of fire hazards commonly found around the house. To do this, you move from room to room, looking for potential risks. To help in the task, each player is given a special ""safely light"" to help uncover lurking dangers. The rooms are large projection screens. When a hazard is discovered, all persons in the room must shine their safety light on the same spot. when they do, the hazard is rendered harmless and points are assigned. After playing in the game to find the hazardous things in the house, I learned a lot of safety tips. It is much easier to remember the tips I learned during the game than those I learned on textbook or internet. I believe kids will enjoy the games and learn from them as well.    I also tried to show this reflection in my project. Thus, I planned to make a game, called the hall of presidents, which test people\'s knowledge of presidents in USA. However, I failed to achieve the goal of making it an entertaining game instead of a quiz. My game was still like a quiz. However, because it is the only code which can work well inside my big game. I decide to still hold the game for my projects in order to what my original ideas are.   4. technology skill limitations    I feel terribly sorry for my limited skills in CS. It is my first time to learn JAVA this semester. I just begin to learn the core concepts of JAVA this month. When I choose to use java code for this project, I know I will face plentiful limitations and problems. Here I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Johnson, who encouraged me not to give up my ideas.   To be honest, I have no idea of how to change a java code into a real game with animations. I know the background story of the game is more important for English course and pictures are the best way to show the background, but I have no idea to show all these things by JAVA coding. Therefore, I choose to use videos for my presentation. In this way, I can show my animation inside the videos while the code clue of my game is still composed by JAVA coding. Also, video gives me a lot of freedom when choose my contents for presentation. I can explain a lot details of my project clearly through videos.    For example, I found the festival parade in the magic kingdom was great and I wanted to share the experience in my project by showing the pictures or videos. However, because of the technology limitations, I can only show the videos in my presentations. Also, I mistakenly deleted my videos which I shot on my trip Orlando, I can only share others\' parade show......   Also, I want to apologize for the incompleteness of my game. I only dedicated to writing codes for Magic Kingdom, a part of my trip during spring break. Writing codes is a really time consuming task for me. In general, I need to spend more than eight hours to finish one project for my CS assignment this semester. While for this project, the final artifacts are composed of several parts of codes and in the end I need to write the father code in order to take care of my code family for spring break. Due to my limitation in writing codes, I can only finish one part of Disney world. However, I think my code shows all my reflections and perspectives during my trip, even though it looks like it only shows one part of my trip.    The terrible mistake I made is that I found out the most of my codes I wrote had significant errors on Tuesday. I went to CS TA office for help, while the errors were still impossible to fix in order to achieve the goal I planned to get. Consequently, my game have to be separated into several parts. Instead of a big game having others as sub-games inside the big one, my final artifacts are composed by several small games. I need to start them one by one. It may cause some inconvenience for players to map their trip in Disney world.",,10

The Leslie property contained 246.8 acres and was located right on the San Francisco Bay. The land had been used for salt evaporation and had an elevation of exactly sea level. However, the property was diked so that the waters from the bay park were kept out. The city of Mountain View intended to fill the property and use it for a city park.   Ultimately,it fell into the courts to determine a fair market value for the property. Appraisers were hired, but what made the processes difficult was that there were few sales of byland property and none of them corresponded exactly to the characteristics of the Leslie property. The experts involved decided to build a regression model to better understand the factors that might influence market valuation. They collected data on 31 byland properties that were sold during the previous 10 years. In addition to the transaction price for each property, they collected data oina large number of other factors, including size, time of sale, elevation, location, and access to sewers.  A listing of these data, including only those variables deemed relevant for this exercise. A description of the variables is provided below.  Variable name  Description  Price  Sales price in $000 per acre  County  San Mateo=0, Santa Clara =1  Size  Size of the property in acres  Elevation  Average Elevation in foot above sea level  Sewer  Distance (in feet) to nearest sewer connection  Date  Date of sale counting backward from current time (in months)  Flood  Subject to flooding by tidal action =1; otherwise =0  Distance  Distance in miles from Leslie Property (in almost all cases, this is toward San Francisco  Discuss and Answer the following questions:  1. What is the nature of each of the variables? Which variable is dependent variable and what are the independent variables in the model?  2. Check whether the variables require any transformation individually  3. Set up a regression equation, run the model and discuss your results",,6

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.                 Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared                 for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He                 quickly hides behind Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          You there. Ogre!                                       SHREK                          Aye?                                       HEAD GUARD                          By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized                           to place you both under arrest and transport                           you to a designated resettlement facility.                                                                  SHREK                          Oh, really? You and what army?                 He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well                 and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail                 and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and                 begins walking back to his cottage.                                        DONKEY                          Can I say something to you? Listen,                           you was really, really, really somethin\'                           back here. Incredible!                                        SHREK                          Are you talkin\' to...(he turns around                           and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back                           around and Donkey is right in front                           of him.) Whoa!                                        DONKEY                          Yes. I was talkin\' to you. Can I tell                           you that you that you was great back                           here? Those guards! They thought they                           was all of that. Then you showed up,                           and bam! They was trippin\' over themselves                           like babes in the woods. That really                           made me feel good to see that.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s great. Really.                                       DONKEY                          Man, it\'s good to be free.                                       SHREK                          Now, why don\'t you go celebrate your                           freedom with your own friends? Hmm?                                                                  DONKEY                          But, uh, I don\'t have any friends. And                           I\'m not goin\' out there by myself. Hey,                           wait a minute! I got a great idea! I\'ll                           stick with you. You\'re mean, green,                           fightin\' machine. Together we\'ll scare                           the spit out of anybody that crosses                           us.                  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very                 loudly.                                        DONKEY                          Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you                           don\'t mind me sayin\', if that don\'t                           work, your breath certainly will get                           the job done, \'cause you definitely                           need some Tic Tacs or something, \'cause                           you breath stinks! You almost burned                           the hair outta my nose, just like the                           time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey                           continues to talk, so Shrek removes                           his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten                           berries. I had strong gases leaking                           out of my butt that day.                                        SHREK                          Why are you following me?                                       DONKEY                          I\'ll tell you why. (singing) \'Cause                           I\'m all alone, There\'s no one here beside                           me, My problems have all gone, There\'s                           no one to deride me, But you gotta have                           faith...                                        SHREK                          Stop singing! It\'s no wonder you don\'t                           have any friends.                                        DONKEY                          Wow. Only a true friend would be that                           cruelly honest.                                        SHREK                          Listen, little donkey. Take a look at                           me. What am I?                                        DONKEY                          (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really                           tall?                                        SHREK                          No! I\'m an ogre! You know. ""Grab your                           torch and pitchforks."" Doesn\'t that                           bother you?                                        DONKEY                          Nope.                                       SHREK                          Really?                                       DONKEY                          Really, really.                                       SHREK                          Oh.                                       DONKEY                          Man, I like you. What\'s you name?                                       SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek? Well, you know what I like about                           you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don\'t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me                           thing. I like that. I respect that,                           Shrek. You all right. (They come over                           a hill and you can see Shrek\'s cottage.)                           Whoa! Look at that. Who\'d want to live                           in place like that?                                        SHREK                          That would be my home.                                       DONKEY                          Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.                           You know you are quite a decorator.                           It\'s amazing what you\'ve done with such                           a modest budget. I like that boulder.                           That is a nice boulder. I guess you                           don\'t entertain much, do you?                                        SHREK                          I like my privacy.                                       DONKEY                          You know, I do too. That\'s another thing                           we have in common. Like I hate it when                           you got somebody in your face. You\'ve                           trying to give them a hint, and they                           won\'t leave. There\'s that awkward silence.                           (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, what?                                       DONKEY                          Can I stay with you, please?                                       SHREK                          (sarcastically) Of course!                                       DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Please! I don\'t wanna go back there!                           You don\'t know what it\'s like to be                           considered a freak. (pause while he                           looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.                           But that\'s why we gotta stick together.                           You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!                                                                  SHREK                          Okay! Okay! But one night only.                                       DONKEY                          Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)                                                                  SHREK                          What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto                           a chair.) No! No!                                        DONKEY                          This is gonna be fun! We can stay up                           late, swappin\' manly stories, and in                           the mornin\' I\'m makin\' waffles.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                                       DONKEY                          Where do, uh, I sleep?                                       SHREK                          (irritated) Outside!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, well, I guess that\'s cool. I mean,                           I don\'t know you, and you don\'t know                           me, so I guess outside is best, you                           know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek                           slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do                           like the outdoors. I\'m a donkey. I was                           born outside. I\'ll just be sitting by                           myself outside, I guess, you know. By                           myself, outside. I\'m all alone...there\'s                           no one here beside me...                  SHREK\'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                 Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights                 a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a                 noise. He stands up with a huff.                                        SHREK                          (to Donkey) I thought I told you to                           stay outside.                                        DONKEY                          (from the window) I am outside.                 There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that                 made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns                 and spots 3 blind mice on his table.                                        BLIND MOUSE1                          Well, gents, it\'s a far cry from the                           farm, but what choice do we have?                                                                  BLIND MOUSE2                          It\'s not home, but it\'ll do just fine.                                                                  GORDO                          (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.                                                                  SHREK                          Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes                           and lands on his shoulder.)                                        GORDO                          I found some cheese. (bites Shrek\'s                           ear)                                        SHREK                          Ow!                                       GORDO                          Blah! Awful stuff.                                       BLIND MOUSE1                          Is that you, Gordo?                                       GORDO                          How did you know?                                       SHREK                          Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are                           you doing in my house? (He gets bumped                           from behind and he drops the mice.)                           Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves                           with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,                           no, no. Dead broad off the table.                                                                  DWARF                          Where are we supposed to put her? The                           bed\'s taken.                                        SHREK                          Huh?                 Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.                 The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at                 him.                                        BIG BAD WOLF                          What?                 TIME LAPSE                 Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging                 him to the front door.                                        SHREK                          I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I\'m                           a terrifying ogre! What do I have to                           do get a little privacy? (He opens the                           front door to throw the Wolf out and                           he sees that all the collected Fairy                           Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,                           no. No! No!                  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his                 pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing                 flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.                                                        SHREK                          What are you doing in my swamp? (this                           echoes and everyone falls silent.)                                            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a                 tent.                                        SHREK                          All right, get out of here. All of you,                           move it! Come on! Let\'s go! Hapaya!                           Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more                           dwarves run inside the house) No, no!                           No, no. Not there. Not there. (they                           shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to                           look at Donkey)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, don\'t look at me. I didn\'t invite                           them.                                        PINOCCHIO                          Oh, gosh, no one invited us.                                       SHREK                          What?                                       PINOCCHIO                          We were forced to come here.                                       SHREK                          (flabbergasted) By who?                                       LITTLE PIG                          Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed                           and he...signed an eviction notice.                                                                  SHREK                          (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where                           this Farquaad guy is?                  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, I do. I know where he is.                                       SHREK                          Does anyone else know where to find                           him? Anyone at all?                                        DONKEY                          Me! Me!                                       SHREK                          Anyone?                                       DONKEY                          Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!                           Me, me!                                        SHREK                          (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy                           tale things. Do not get comfortable.                           Your welcome is officially worn out.                           In fact, I\'m gonna see this guy Farquaad                           right now and get you all off my land                           and back where you came from! (Pause.                           Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)                           You! You\'re comin\' with me.                                        DONKEY                          All right, that\'s what I like to hear,                           man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart                           friends, off on a whirlwind big-city                           adventure. I love it!                                        DONKEY                          (singing) On the road again. Sing it                           with me, Shrek. I can\'t wait to get                           on the road again.                                        SHREK                          What did I say about singing?                                       DONKEY                          Can I whistle?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Can I hum it?                                       SHREK                          All right, hum it.                 Donkey begins to hum \'On the Road Again\'.                 DULOC - KITCHEN                 A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He\'s continually                 dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.                                        FARQUAAD                          That\'s enough. He\'s ready to talk.                                            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down                 onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the                 table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes                 up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.                                                        FARQUAAD                          (he picks up the Gingerbread Man\'s legs                           and plays with them) Run, run, run,                           as fast as you can. You can\'t catch                           me. I\'m the gingerbread man.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          You are a monster.                                       FARQUAAD                          I\'m not the monster here. You are. You                           and the rest of that fairy tale trash,                           poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell                           me! Where are the others?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad\'s                           eye.)                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ve tried to be fair to you creatures.                           Now my patience has reached its end!                           Tell me or I\'ll...(he makes as if to                           pull off the Gingerbread Man\'s buttons)                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop                           buttons.                                        FARQUAAD                          All right then. Who\'s hiding them?                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          Okay, I\'ll tell you. Do you know the                           muffin man?                                        FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?                                       GINGERBREAD MAN                          The muffin man.                                       FARQUAAD                          Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives                           on Drury Lane?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Well, she\'s married to the muffin man.                                                                  FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?                                       GINGERBREAD MAN                          The muffin man!                                       FARQUAAD                          She\'s married to the muffin man.                 The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.                                       HEAD GUARD                          My lord! We found it.                                       FARQUAAD                          Then what are you waiting for? Bring                           it in.                  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.                 They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic                 Mirror.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          (in awe) Ohhhh...

(Farquaad picks                           him up and dumps him into a trash can                           with a lid.) No!                                        FARQUAAD                          Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.                           Is this not the most perfect kingdom                           of them all?

(Thelonius holds up a                           hand mirror and smashes it with his                           fist.) You were saying?                                        MIRROR                          What I mean is you\'re not a king yet.                           But you can become one. All you have                           to do is marry a princess.                                        FARQUAAD                          Go on.                                       MIRROR                          (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back                           and relax, my lord, because it\'s time                           for you to meet today\'s eligible bachelorettes.                           And here they are! Bachelorette number                           one is a mentally abused shut-in from                           a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi                           and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies                           include cooking and cleaning for her                           two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.                           (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette                           number two is a cape-wearing girl from                           the land of fancy. Although she lives                           with seven other men, she\'s not easy.                           Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and                           find out what a live wire she is. Come                           on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows                           picture of Snow White) And last, but                           certainly not last, bachelorette number                           three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded                           castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!                           But don\'t let that cool you off. She\'s                           a loaded pistol who likes pina colads                           and getting caught in the rain. Yours                           for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

MIRROR                          Lord Farquaad, you\'ve chosen Princess                           Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona. She\'s perfect. All I                           have to do is just find someone who                           can go...                                        MIRROR                          But I probably should mention the little                           thing that happens at night.                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ll do it.                                       MIRROR                          Yes, but after sunset...                                       FARQUAAD                          Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona                           my queen, and DuLoc will finally have                           the perfect king! Captain, assemble                           your finest men. We\'re going to have                           a tournament. (smiles evilly)                  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section                 Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking                 lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.                                        DONKEY                          But that\'s it. That\'s it right there.                           That\'s DuLoc. I told ya I\'d find it.                                                                  SHREK                          So, that must be Lord Farquaad\'s castle.                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh-huh. That\'s the place.                                       SHREK                          Do you think maybe he\'s compensating                           for something? (He laughs, but then                           groans as Donkey doesn\'t get the joke.                           He continues walking through the parking                           lot.)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.                                       MAN                          Hurry, darling. We\'re late. Hurry.                                                                  SHREK                          Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing                           a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,                           screams and begins running through the                           rows of rope to get to the front gate                           to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.                           Look, I\'m not gonna eat you. I just                           - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins                           walking straight through the rows. The                           attendant runs into a wall and falls                           down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then                           continue on into DuLoc.)                  DULOC                 They look around but all is quiet.                                       SHREK                          It\'s quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?                                                                  DONKEY                          Hey, look at this!                 Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box                 marked \'Information\'. The music winds up and then the box doors                 open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin                 to sing.                                        WOODEN PEOPLE                          Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town                                            Here we have some rules                 Let us lay them down                 Don\'t make waves, stay in line                 And we\'ll get along fine                 DuLoc is perfect place                 Please keep off of the grass                 Shine your shoes, wipe your... face                 DuLoc is, DuLoc is                 DuLoc is perfect place.                 Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek\'s picture.                                       DONKEY                          Wow! Let\'s do that again! (makes ready                           to run over and pull the lever again)                                                                  SHREK                          (grabs Donkey\'s tail and holds him still)                           No. No. No, no, no! No.                  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.                                       FARQUAAD                          Brave knights. You are the best and                           brightest in all the land. Today one                           of you shall prove himself...                  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena                 Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.                                        SHREK                          All right. You\'re going the right way                           for a smacked bottom.                                        DONKEY                          Sorry about that.                                       FARQUAAD                          That champion shall have the honor -                           - no, no - - the privilege to go forth                           and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona                           from the fiery keep of the dragon. If                           for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,                           the first runner-up will take his place                           and so on and so forth. Some of you                           may die, but it\'s a sacrifice I am willing                           to make. (cheers) Let the tournament                           begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is                           that? It\'s hideous!                                        SHREK                          (turns to look at Donkey and then back                           at Farquaad) Ah, that\'s not very nice.                           It\'s just a donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who                           kills the ogre will be named champion!                           Have it him!                                        MEN                          Get him!                                       SHREK                          Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps                           into a table where there are mugs of                           beer)                                        CROWD                          Go ahead! Get him!                                       SHREK                          (holds up a mug of beer) Can\'t we just                           settle this over a pint?                                        CROWD                          Kill the beast!                                       SHREK                          No? All right then. (drinks the beer)                           Come on!                  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel                 of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the                 other men and wetting the ground. It\'s like mud now. Shrek slides                 past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.                 As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger                 beer barrels. It breaks free of it\'s ropes and begins to roll.                 Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much                 fighting going on here I\'m not going to go into detail. Suffice                 to say that Shrek kicks butt.                                        DONKEY                          Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!                 Shrek comes over and bangs a man\'s head up against Donkeys. Shrek                 gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.                                        SHREK                          Yeah!                 A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time                 and sees him.                                        WOMAN                          The chair! Give him the chair!                 Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men                 are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding                 sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.                                        SHREK                          Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you                           very much! I\'m here till Thursday. Try                           the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)                  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on                 Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Shall I give the order, sir?                                       FARQUAAD                          No, I have a better idea. People of                           DuLoc, I give you our champion!                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FARQUAAD                          Congratulations, ogre. You\'re won the                           honor of embarking on a great and noble                           quest.                                        SHREK                          Quest? I\'m already in a quest, a quest                           to get my swamp back.                                        FARQUAAD                          Your swamp?                                       SHREK                          Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those                           fairy tale creatures!                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. All right, ogre. I\'ll make you                           a deal. Go on this quest for me, and                           I\'ll give you your swamp back.                                        SHREK                          Exactly the way it was?                                       FARQUAAD                          Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.                                                                  SHREK                          And the squatters?                                       FARQUAAD                          As good as gone.                                       SHREK                          What kind of quest?                 Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field                 heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.                                        DONKEY                          Let me get this straight. You\'re gonna                           go fight a dragon and rescue a princess                           just so Farquaad will give you back                           a swamp which you only don\'t have because                           he filled it full of freaks in the first                           place. Is that about right?                                        SHREK                          You know, maybe there\'s a good reason                           donkeys shouldn\'t talk.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t get it. Why don\'t you just pull                           some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle                           him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds                           his bones to make your bread, the whole                           ogre trip.                                        SHREK                          Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have                           decapitated an entire village and put                           their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,                           cut open their spleen and drink their                           fluids.

DONKEY                          You know what else everybody likes?                           Parfaits.

SHREK                          You know, I think I preferred your humming.                                                                  DONKEY                          Do you have a tissue or something? I\'m                           making a mess. Just the word parfait                           make me start slobbering.                  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through                 a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying                 to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,                 so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.                  DRAGON\'S KEEP                 Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that\'s supposed to                 house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.                                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?                           You gotta warn somebody before you just                           crack one off. My mouth was open and                           everything.                                        SHREK                          Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you\'d                           be dead. (sniffs) It\'s brimstone. We                           must be getting close.                                        DONKEY                          Yeah, right, brimstone. Don\'t be talking                           about it\'s the brimstone. I know what                           I smell. It wasn\'t no brimstone. It                           didn\'t come off no stone neither.                                            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There                 is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where                 the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very                 foreboding.                                        SHREK                          Sure, it\'s big enough, but look at the                           location. (laughs...then the laugh turns                           into a groan)                                        DONKEY                          Uh, Shrek?

Donkeys don\'t have sleeves.                                                                  DONKEY                          You know what I mean.                                       SHREK                          You can\'t tell me you\'re afraid of heights.                                                                  DONKEY                          No, I\'m just a little uncomfortable                           about being on a rickety bridge over                           a boiling like of lava!

With a dragon that breathes fire                           and eats knights and breathes fire,                           it sure doesn\'t mean you\'re a coward                           if you\'re a little scared. I sure as                           heck ain\'t no coward. I know that.                                                                  SHREK                          Donkey, two things, okay?

SHREK                          (putting on a helmet) The princess will                           be up the stairs in the highest room                           in the tallest tower.

I\'ll find those stairs.                           I\'ll whip their butt too. Those stairs                           won\'t know which way they\'re goin\'.                           (walks off)                  EMPTY ROOM                 Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.                                                        DONKEY                          I\'m gonna take drastic steps. Kick it                           to the curb. Don\'t mess with me. I\'m                           the stair master. I\'ve mastered the                           stairs. I wish I had a step right here.                           I\'d step all over it.                  ELSEWHERE                 Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.                                       SHREK                          Well, at least we know where the princess                           is, but where\'s the...                                        DONKEY                          (os) Dragon!                 Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again.                 Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon                 breathes fire.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, look out! (he manages to get                           a hold of the dragons tail and holds                           on) Got ya!                  The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it\'s tail and Shrek                 goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the                 tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying                 on the floor.                                        DONKEY                          Oh! Aah! Aah!                 Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small                 part of the bridge he\'s on.                                        DONKEY                          No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,                           what large teeth you have. (the dragon                           growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.                           I know you probably hear this all time                           from your food, but you must bleach,                           \'cause that is one dazzling smile you                           got there. Do I detect a hint of minty                           freshness? And you know what else? You\'re                           - - You\'re a girl dragon! Oh, sure!                           I mean, of course you\'re a girl dragon.                           You\'re just reeking of feminine beauty.                           (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes                           at him) What\'s the matter with you?                           You got something in your eye? Ohh.                           Oh. Oh. Man, I\'d really love to stay,                           but you know, I\'m, uh...(the dragon                           blows a smoke ring in the shape of a                           heart right at him, and he coughs) I\'m                           an asthmatic, and I don\'t know if it\'d                           work out if you\'re gonna blow smoke                           rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him                           up with her teeth and carries him off)                           No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!                  FIONA\'S ROOM                 Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona                 so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She                 then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off                 the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.                 Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for                 a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders                 and shakes her away.                                        FIONA                          Oh! Oh!                                       SHREK                          Wake up!                                       FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          Are you Princess Fiona?                                       FIONA                          I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s nice. Now let\'s go!                                       FIONA                          But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our                           first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,                           romantic moment?                                        SHREK                          Yeah, sorry, lady. There\'s no time.                                                                  FIONA                          Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should                           sweep me off my feet out yonder window                           and down a rope onto your valiant steed.                                                                  SHREK                          You\'ve had a lot of time to plan this,                           haven\'t you?                                        FIONA                          (smiles) Mm-hmm.                 Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down                 the hallway.                                        FIONA                          But we have to savor this moment! You                           could recite an epic poem for me. A                           ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!                                                                  SHREK                          I don\'t think so.                                       FIONA                          Can I at least know the name of my champion?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       FIONA                          Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds                           out a handkerchief) I pray that you                           take this favor as a token of my gratitude.                                                                  SHREK                          Thanks!                 Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.                                       FIONA                          (surprised)You didn\'t slay the dragon?                                                                  SHREK                          It\'s on my to-do list. Now come on!                           (takes off running and drags Fiona behind                           him.)                                        FIONA                          But this isn\'t right! You were meant                           to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.                           That\'s what all the other knights did.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, right before they burst into flame.                                                                  FIONA                          That\'s not the point. (Shrek suddenly                           stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek                           ignores her and heads for a wooden door                           off to the side.) Wait. Where are you                           going? The exit\'s over there.                                        SHREK                          Well, I have to save my ass.                                       FIONA                          What kind of knight are you?                                       SHREK                          One of a kind. (opens the door into                           the throne room)                                        DONKEY                          (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.                           I believe it\'s healthy to get to know                           someone over a long period of time.                           Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs                           worriedly) (we see him up close and                           from a distance as Shrek sneaks into                           the room) I don\'t want to rush into                           a physical relationship. I\'m not emotionally                           ready for a commitment of, uh, this                           - - Magnitude really is the word I\'m                           looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that                           is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what                           are you doing? Okay, okay. Let\'s just                           back up a little and take this one step                           at a time. We really should get to know                           each other first as friends or pen pals.                           I\'m on the road a lot, but I just love                           receiving cards - - I\'d really love                           to stay, but - - Don\'t do that! That\'s                           my tail! That\'s my personal tail. You\'re                           gonna tear it off. I don\'t give permission                           - - What are you gonna do with that?                           Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.                           No, no, no. No! Oh!                  Shrek grabs a chain that\'s connected to the chandelier and swings                 toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks                 up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.                 He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps                 Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.                 Instead the dragon kisses Shreks\' butt. She opens her eyes and                 roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto                 her head, but it\'s too big and it goes over her head and forms                 a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey                 take off running. Very \'Matrix\' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and                 then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.                                        DONKEY                          Hi, Princess!                                       FIONA                          It talks!                                       SHREK                          Yeah, it\'s getting him to shut up that\'s                           the trick.                  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots                 a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a                 crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His                 eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles                 off and walks lightly.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                 Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.                                                        SHREK                          Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I\'ll                           take care of the dragon.                  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the                 castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping                 chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that                 is still around the dragons neck.                                        SHREK                          (echoing) Run!                 They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot                 pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons                 breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on                 for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They                 are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look                 in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to                 get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the                 dragon back and she\'s unable to get to them. Our gang climbs                 quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a                 sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.                                        FIONA                          (sliding down the \'volcano\' hill) You                           did it! You rescued me! You\'re amazing.                           (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)                           You\'re - - You\'re wonderful. You\'re...                           (turns and sees Shrek fall down the                           hill and bump into Donkey) a little                           unorthodox I\'ll admit. But thy deed                           is great, and thy heart is pure. I am                           eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears                           his throat.) And where would a brave                           knight be without his noble steed?                                                                  DONKEY                          I hope you heard that. She called me                           a noble steed. She think I\'m a steed.                                                                  FIONA                          The battle is won. You may remove your                           helmet, good Sir Knight.

SHREK                          I have helmet hair.                                       FIONA                          Please. I would\'st look upon the face                           of my rescuer.                                        SHREK                          No, no, you wouldn\'t - - \'st.                                       FIONA                          But how will you kiss me?                                       SHREK                          What? (to Donkey) That wasn\'t in the                           job description.                                        DONKEY                          Maybe it\'s a perk.                                       FIONA                          No, it\'s destiny. Oh, you must know                           how it goes. A princess locked in a                           tower and beset by a dragon is rescued                           by a brave knight, and then they share                           true love\'s first kiss.                                        DONKEY                          Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.                           Wait. You think that Shrek is you true                           love?                                        FIONA                          Well, yes.                 Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.                                       DONKEY                          You think Shrek is your true love!                                                                  FIONA                          What is so funny?                                       SHREK                          Let\'s just say I\'m not your type, okay?Fiona:                           Of course, you are. You\'re my rescuer.                           Now - - Now remove your helmet.                                        SHREK                          Look. I really don\'t think this is a                           good idea.                                        FIONA                          Just take off the helmet.                                       SHREK                          I\'m not going to.                                       FIONA                          Take it off.                                       SHREK                          No!                                       FIONA                          Now!                                       SHREK                          Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.                           (takes off his helmet)                                        FIONA                          You- - You\'re a- - an ogre.                                       SHREK                          Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.                                                                  FIONA                          Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is                           all wrong. You\'re not supposed to be                           an ogre.                                        SHREK                          Princess, I was sent to rescue you by                           Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who                           wants to marry you.                                        FIONA                          Then why didn\'t he come rescue me?                                                                  SHREK                          Good question. You should ask him that                           when we get there.                                        FIONA                          But I have to be rescued by my true                           love, not by some ogre and his- - his                           pet.                                        DONKEY                          Well, so much for noble steed.                                       SHREK                          You\'re not making my job any easier.                                                                  FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but your job is not my problem.                           You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he                           wants to rescue me properly, I\'ll be                           waiting for him right here.                                        SHREK                          Hey! I\'m no one\'s messenger boy, all                           right? (ominous) I\'m a delivery boy.                           (he swiftly picks her up and swings                           her over his shoulder like she was a                           sack of potatoes)                                        FIONA                          You wouldn\'t dare. Put me down!                                       SHREK                          Ya comin\', Donkey?                                       DONKEY                          I\'m right behind ya.                                       FIONA                          Put me down, or you will suffer the                           consequences! This is not dignified!                           Put me down!                  WOODS                 A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just                 hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, so here\'s another question. Say                           there\'s a woman that digs you, right,                           but you don\'t really like her that way.                           How do you let her down real easy so                           her feelings aren\'t hurt, but you don\'t                           get burned to a crisp and eaten?                                        FIONA                          You just tell her she\'s not your true                           love. Everyone knows what happens when                           you find your...(Shrek drops her on                           the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to                           DuLoc the better.                                        DONKEY                          You\'re gonna love it there, Princess.                           It\'s beautiful!                                        FIONA                          And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?                           What\'s he like?                                        SHREK                          Let me put it this way, Princess. Men                           of Farquaad\'s stature are in short supply.                           (he and Donkey laugh)                  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off                 the dust and grime.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t know. There are those who think                           little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:                           Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You\'re                           just jealous you can never measure up                           to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, well, maybe you\'re right, Princess.                           But I\'ll let you do the ""measuring""                           when you see him tomorrow.                                        FIONA                          (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?                           It\'ll take that long? Shouldn\'t we stop                           to make camp?                                        SHREK                          No, that\'ll take longer. We can keep                           going.                                        FIONA                          But there\'s robbers in the woods.                                       DONKEY                          Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting                           to sound good.                                        SHREK                          Hey, come on. I\'m scarier than anything                           we\'re going to see in this forest.                                                                  FIONA                          I need to find somewhere to camp now!                                            Both Donkey and Shrek\'s ears lower as they shrink away from her.                                  MOUNTAIN CLIFF                 Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves                 a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.                                        SHREK                          Hey! Over here.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, we can do better than that. I                           don\'t think this is fit for a princess.                                                                  FIONA                          No, no, it\'s perfect. It just needs                           a few homey touches.                                        SHREK                          Homey touches? Like what? (he hears                           a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona                           who has torn the bark off of a tree.)                                                                  FIONA                          A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee                           good night. (goes into the cave and                           puts the bark door up behind her)                                                                  DONKEY                          You want me to read you a bedtime story?                           I will.                                        FIONA                          (os) I said good night!                 Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the                 boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona                 still inside.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, What are you doing?                                       SHREK                          (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,                           come on. I was just kidding.                  LATER THAT NIGHT                 Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring                 up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations                 to Donkey.                                        SHREK                          And, uh, that one, that\'s Throwback,                           the only ogre to ever spit over three                           wheat fields.                                        DONKEY                          Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future                           from these stars?                                        SHREK                          The stars don\'t tell the future, Donkey.                           They tell stories. Look, there\'s Bloodnut,                           the Flatulent. You can guess what he\'s                           famous for.                                        DONKEY                          I know you\'re making this up.                                       SHREK                          No, look. There he is, and there\'s the                           group of hunters running away from his                           stench.                                        DONKEY                          That ain\'t nothin\' but a bunch of little                           dots.                                        SHREK                          You know, Donkey, sometimes things are                           more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.                                                                  DONKEY                          (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what                           we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?                                                                  SHREK                          Our swamp?                                       DONKEY                          You know, when we\'re through rescuing                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          We? Donkey, there\'s no ""we"". There\'s                           no ""our"". There\'s just me and my swamp.                           The first thing I\'m gonna do is build                           a ten-foot wall around my land.                                        DONKEY                          You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real                           deep just now. You know what I think?                           I think this whole wall thing is just                           a way to keep somebody out.                                        SHREK                          No, do ya think?                                       DONKEY                          Are you hidin\' something?

DONKEY                          Oh, this is another one of those onion                           things, isn\'t it?                                        SHREK                          No, this is one of those drop-it and                           leave-it alone things.                                        DONKEY                          Why don\'t you want to talk about it?                                                                  SHREK                          Why do you want to talk about it?                                       DONKEY                          Why are you blocking?                                       SHREK                          I\'m not blocking.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yes, you are.                                       SHREK                          Donkey, I\'m warning you.                                       DONKEY                          Who you trying to keep out?                                       SHREK                          Everyone! Okay?                                       DONKEY                          (pause) Oh, now we\'re gettin\' somewhere.                           (grins)                  At this point Fiona pulls the \'door\' away from the entrance to                 the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.                                        SHREK                          Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and                           walks over to the edge of the cliff                           and sits down)                                        DONKEY                          What\'s your problem? What you got against                           the whole world anyway?                                        SHREK                          Look, I\'m not the one with the problem,                           okay? It\'s the world that seems to have                           a problem with me. People take one look                           at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big,                           stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before                           they even know me. That\'s why I\'m better                           off alone.                                        DONKEY                          You know what? When we met, I didn\'t                           think you was just a big, stupid, ugly                           ogre.                                        SHREK                          Yeah, I know.                                       DONKEY                          So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?                                                                  SHREK                          Well, there\'s, um, Gabby, the Small                           and Annoying.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny                           one, right there. That one there?                                            Fiona puts the door back.                                       SHREK                          That\'s the moon.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, okay.                 DuLoc - Farquaad\'s Bedroom                 The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays                 in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic                 Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,                           show her to me. Show me the princess.                                                                  MIRROR                          Hmph.                 The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Ah. Perfect.                 Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up                 to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly                 at her image in the mirror.                  MORNING                 Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey                 who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes                 across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along                 with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles                 to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too                 big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but                 she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona                 is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still                 sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey\'s talking                 in his sleep.                                        DONKEY                          (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like                           it like that. Come on, baby. I said                           I like it.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)                                       DONKEY                          Huh? What?                                       SHREK                          Wake up.                                       DONKEY                          What? (stretches and yawns)                                       FIONA                          Good morning. Hm, how do you like your                           eggs?                                        DONKEY                          Oh, good morning, Princess!                 Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.                                       SHREK                          What\'s all this about?                                       FIONA                          You know, we kind of got off to a bad                           start yesterday. I wanted to make it                           up to you. I mean, after all, you did                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Uh, thanks.                 Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.                                       FIONA                          Well, eat up. We\'ve got a big day ahead                           of us. (walks off)                  LATER                 They are once again on their way. They are walking through the                 forest. Shrek belches.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek!                                       SHREK                          What? It\'s a compliment. Better out                           than in, I always say. (laughs)                                        DONKEY                          Well, it\'s no way to behave in front                           of a princess.                  Fiona belches                                       FIONA                          Thanks.                                       DONKEY                          She\'s as nasty as you are.                                       SHREK                          (chuckles) You know, you\'re not exactly                           what I expected.                                        FIONA                          Well, maybe you shouldn\'t judge people                           before you get to know them.                  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly                 from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into                 a tree.                                        ROBIN HOOD                          La liberte! Hey!                                       SHREK                          Princess!

And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses                           up her arm while Fiona pulls back in                           disgust)...beast.                                        SHREK                          Hey! That\'s my princess! Go find you                           own!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Please, monster! Can\'t you see I\'m a                           little busy here?                                        FIONA                          (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don\'t                           know who you think you are!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please                           let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.                           (laughs)                  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out                 from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin\'s theme song.                                        MERRY MEN                          Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          I steal from the rich and give to the                           needy.                                        MERRY MEN                          He takes a wee percentage,                                       ROBIN HOOD                          But I\'m not greedy. I rescue pretty                           damsels, man, I\'m good.                                        MERRY MEN                          What a guy, Monsieur Hood.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          Break it down. I like an honest fight                           and a saucy little maid...                                        MERRY MEN                          What he\'s basically saying is he likes                           to get...                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush                           grabs a lady by the tush. That\'s bad.                                                                  MERRY MEN                          That\'s bad.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          When a beauty\'s with a beast it makes                           me awfully mad.                                        MERRY MEN                          He\'s mad, he\'s really, really mad.                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          I\'ll take my blade and ram it through                           your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys                           \'cause I\'m about to start...                  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and                 knocks Robin Hood unconscious.                                        FIONA                          Man, that was annoying!                 Shrek looks at her in admiration.                                       MERRY MAN                          Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at                           Fiona but she ducks out of the way)                                            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek\'s arms to                 get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.                                  Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and                 then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is                 a very interesting \'Matrix\' moment here when Fiona pauses in                 mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,                 and Fiona begins walking away.                                        FIONA                          Uh, shall we?                                       SHREK                          Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins                           walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,                           whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come                           from?                                        FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          That! Back there. That was amazing!                           Where did you learn that?                                        FIONA                          Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,                           uh, one has to learn these things in                           case there\'s a...(gasps and points)                           there\'s an arrow in your butt!                                        SHREK                          What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you                           look at that? (he goes to pull it out                           but flinches because it\'s tender)                                                                  FIONA                          Oh, no. This is all my fault. I\'m so                           sorry.                                        DONKEY                          (walking up) Why? What\'s wrong?                                       FIONA                          Shrek\'s hurt.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek\'s hurt. Shrek\'s hurt? Oh, no,                           Shrek\'s gonna die.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, I\'m okay.                                       DONKEY                          You can\'t do this to me, Shrek. I\'m                           too young for you to die. Keep you legs                           elevated. Turn your head and cough.                           Does anyone know the Heimlich?                                        FIONA                          Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help                           Shrek, run into the woods and find me                           a blue flower with red thorns.                                        DONKEY                          Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I\'m on                           it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don\'t die                           Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay                           away from the light!                                        SHREK & FIONA                          Donkey!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.                           (runs off)                                        SHREK                          What are the flowers for?                                       FIONA                          (like it\'s obvious) For getting rid                           of Donkey.                                        SHREK                          Ah.                                       FIONA                          Now you hold still, and I\'ll yank this                           thing out. (gives the arrow a little                           pull)                                        SHREK                          (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the                           yankin\'.                  As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and                 Shrek keeps dodging her hands.                                        FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but it has to come out.                                                                  SHREK                          No, it\'s tender.                                       FIONA                          Now, hold on.                                       SHREK                          What you\'re doing is the opposite of                           help.                                        FIONA                          Don\'t move.                                       SHREK                          Look, time out.                                       FIONA                          Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his                           hand over her face to stop her from                           getting at the arrow) Okay. What do                           you propose we do?                  ELSEWHERE                 Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

This would be so much easier if I wasn\'t                           color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.

(rips a                           flower off a nearby bush that just happens                           to be a blue flower with red thorns)                                            THE FOREST PATH                                       SHREK                          Ow!

(Shrek grunts as she pulls) It\'s just                           about...                                        SHREK                          Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall                           over with Fiona on top of him)                                        DONKEY                          Ahem.                                       SHREK                          (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing                           happend. We were just, uh - -                                        DONKEY                          Look, if you wanted to be alone, all                           you had to do was ask.

The princess here was just-                           - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he                           turns to look at Fiona who holds up                           the arrow with a smile) Ow!                                        DONKEY                          Hey, what\'s that? (nervous chuckle)                           That\'s...is that blood?                  Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue                 on their way.                  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.                 Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a                 small brook so that Fiona won\'t get wet. Shrek then gets up as                 Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back                 into it\'s upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting                 and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb                 that\'s on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it                 around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins                 eating like it\'s a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.                 Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting                 it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning                 it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group                 arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.                  WINDMILL                                       SHREK                          There it is, Princess. Your future awaits                           you.                                        FIONA                          That\'s DuLoc?                                       DONKEY                          Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks                           Lord Farquaad\'s compensating for something,                           which I think means he has a really...(Shrek                           steps on his hoof) Ow!                                        SHREK                          Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move                           on.                                        FIONA                          Sure. But, Shrek? I\'m - - I\'m worried                           about Donkey.                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FIONA                          I mean, look at him. He doesn\'t look                           so good.                                        DONKEY                          What are you talking about? I\'m fine.                                                                  FIONA                          (kneels to look him in the eyes) That\'s                           what they always say, and then next                           thing you know, you\'re on your back.

Do you want to sit down?                                        FIONA                          Uh, you know, I\'ll make you some tea.

SUNSET                 Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while                 Fiona eats.                                        FIONA                          Mmm.

Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks                 at Shrek with a new eye.                                        DONKEY                          Ohh!

TIME LAPSE                 Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is                 nowhere to be seen.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,                           where are you? Princess?

She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking                 out.                                        DONKEY                          Aah!

I saw this flower                           and thought of you because it\'s pretty                           and - - well, I don\'t really like it,                           but I thought you might like it \'cause                           you\'re pretty. But I like you anyway.                           I\'d - - uh, uh...(sighs) I\'m in trouble.                           Okay, here we go.                  He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey                 and Fiona talking.                                        FIONA                          (os) I can\'t just marry whoever I want.                           Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean,                           really, who can ever love a beast so                           hideous and ugly? ""Princess"" and ""ugly""                           don\'t go together. That\'s why I can\'t                           stay here with Shrek.                  Shrek steps back in shock.                                       FIONA                          (os) My only chance to live happily                           ever after is to marry my true love.                                            Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks                 away.                  INSIDE                                       FIONA                          Don\'t you see, Donkey? That\'s just how                           it has to be. It\'s the only way to break                           the spell.                                        DONKEY                          You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.                                                                  FIONA                          No! You can\'t breathe a word. No one                           must ever know.                                        DONKEY                          What\'s the point of being able to talk                           if you gotta keep secrets?                                        FIONA                          Promise you won\'t tell. Promise!                                       DONKEY                          All right, all right. I won\'t tell him.                           But you should. (goes outside) I just                           know before this is over, I\'m gonna                           need a whole lot of serious therapy.                           Look at my eye twitchin\'.                  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks                 down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back                 inside the windmill.                  MORNING                 Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still                 awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.                                        FIONA                          I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,                           I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly                           runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!                           Shrek, there\'s something I want...(she                           looks and sees the rising sun, and as                           the sun crests the sky she turns back                           into a human.)                  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards                 her.                                        FIONA                          Shrek. Are you all right?                                       SHREK                          Perfect! Never been better.                                       FIONA                          I - - I don\'t - - There\'s something                           I have to tell you.                                        SHREK                          You don\'t have to tell me anything,                           Princess. I heard enough last night.                                                                  FIONA                          You heard what I said?                                       SHREK                          Every word.                                       FIONA                          I thought you\'d understand.                                       SHREK                          Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who                           could love a hideous, ugly beast?""                                                                  FIONA                          But I thought that wouldn\'t matter to                           you.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at                           him in shock. He looks past her and                           spots a group approaching.) Ah, right                           on time. Princess, I\'ve brought you                           a little something.                  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal                 sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he\'s only                 like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers                 march by.                                        DONKEY                          What\'d I miss? What\'d I miss? (spots                           the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?                           Couldn\'t have been the donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona.                                       SHREK                          As promised. Now hand it over.                                       FARQUAAD                          Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece                           of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared                           out, as agreed. Take it and go before                           I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)                           Forgive me, Princess, for startling                           you, but you startled me, for I have                           never seen such a radiant beauty before.                           I\'m Lord Farquaad.                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad                           snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,                           for I was just saying a short... (Watches                           as Farquaad is lifted off his horse                           and set down in front of her. He comes                           to her waist.) farewell.                                        FARQUAAD                          Oh, that is so sweet. You don\'t have                           to waste good manners on the ogre. It\'s                           not like it has feelings.                                        FIONA                          No, you\'re right. It doesn\'t.                 Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless                           Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.                           Will you be the perfect bride for the                           perfect groom?                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would                           make - -                                        FARQUAAD                          (interrupting) Excellent! I\'ll start                           the plans, for tomorrow we wed!                                        FIONA                          No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let\'s get                           married today before the sun sets.                                                                  FARQUAAD                          Oh, anxious, are you? You\'re right.                           The sooner, the better. There\'s so much                           to do! There\'s the caterer, the cake,                           the band, the guest list. Captain, round                           up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona                           on the back of his horse)                                        FIONA                          Fare-thee-well, ogre.                 Farquaad\'s whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches                 them go.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, what are you doing? You\'re letting                           her get away.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? So what?                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, there\'s something about her you                           don\'t know. Look, I talked to her last                           night, She\'s - -                                        SHREK                          I know you talked to her last night.                           You\'re great pals, aren\'t ya? Now, if                           you two are such good friends, why don\'t                           you follow her home?                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.                                       SHREK                          I told you, didn\'t I? You\'re not coming                           home with me. I live alone! My swamp!                           Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!                           Especially useless, pathetic, annoying,                           talking donkeys!                                        DONKEY                          But I thought - -                                       SHREK                          Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!                           (stomps off)                                        DONKEY                          Shrek.                 Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona                 being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running                 into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner                 alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.                  SHREK\'S HOME                 Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes                 outside to investigate.                                        SHREK                          Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues                           with what he\'s doing.) What are you                           doing?                                        DONKEY                          I would think, of all people, you would                           recognize a wall when you see one.                                                                  SHREK                          Well, yeah. But the wall\'s supposed                           to go around my swamp, not through it.                                                                  DONKEY                          It is around your half. See that\'s your                           half, and this is my half.                                        SHREK                          Oh! Your half. Hmm.                                       DONKEY                          Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.                           I did half the work. I get half the                           booty. Now hand me that big old rock,                           the one that looks like your head.                                                                  SHREK                          Back off!                                       DONKEY                          No, you back off.                                       SHREK                          This is my swamp!                                       DONKEY                          Our swamp.

FARQUAAD                          Outrageous! Fiona, don\'t listen to him.                                                                  SHREK                          He\'s not your true love.                                       FIONA                          And what do you know about true love?                                                                  SHREK                          Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -                                       FARQUAAD                          Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen                           in love with the princess! Oh, good                           Lord. (laughs)                  The prompter card guy holds up a card that says \'Laugh\'. The                 whole congregation laughs.                                        FARQUAAD                          An ogre and a princess!                                       FIONA                          Shrek, is this true?                                       FARQUAAD                          Who cares? It\'s preposterous! Fiona,                           my love, we\'re but a kiss away from                           our ""happily ever after."" Now kiss me!                           (puckers his lips and leans toward her,                           but she pulls back.)                                        FIONA                          (looking at the setting sun) ""By night                           one way, by day another."" (to Shrek)                           I wanted to show you before.                  She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self.                 She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.                                        SHREK                          Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona                           smiles)                                        FARQUAAD                          Ugh! It\'s disgusting! Guards! Guards!                           I order you to get that out of my sight                           now! Get them! Get them both!                  The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights                 them.                                        SHREK                          No, no!                                       FIONA                          Shrek!                                       FARQUAAD                          This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This                           marriage is binding, and that makes                           me king! See? See?                                        FIONA                          No, let go of me! Shrek!                                       SHREK                          No!

Arrgh!                                       FARQUAAD                          I\'ll make you regret the day we met.                           I\'ll see you drawn and quartered! You\'ll                           beg for death to save you!                                        FIONA                          No, Shrek!                                       FARQUAAD                          (hold a dagger to Fiona\'s throat) And                           as for you, my wife...

Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.                                       FARQUAAD                          I will have order! I will have perfection!                           I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon                           show up and the dragon leans down and                           eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!                                        DONKEY                          All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon                           here, and I\'m not afraid to use it.                           (The dragon roars.) I\'m a donkey on                           the edge!                  The dragon belches and Farquaad\'s crown flies out of her mouth                 and falls to the ground.                                        DONKEY                          Celebrity marriages. They never last,                           do they?                  The congregation cheers.                                       DONKEY                          Go ahead, Shrek.                                       SHREK                          Uh, Fiona?                                       FIONA                          Yes, Shrek?                                       SHREK                          I - - I love you.                                       FIONA                          Really?                                       SHREK                          Really, really.                                       FIONA                          (smiles) I love you too.                 Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes                 \'Awwww\' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.                                                        CONGREGATION                          Aawww!                 Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She\'s lifted                 up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around                 her.                                        WHISPERS                          ""Until you find true love\'s first kiss                           and then take love\'s true form. Take                           love\'s true form. Take love\'s true form.""                                            Suddenly Fiona\'s eyes open wide. She\'s consumed by the spell                 and then is slowly lowered to the ground.                                        SHREK                          (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are                           you all right?                                        FIONA                          (standing up, she\'s still an ogre) Well,                           yes. But I don\'t understand. I\'m supposed                           to be beautiful.                                        SHREK                          But you ARE beautiful.                 They smile at each other.                                       DONKEY                          (chuckles) I was hoping this would be                           a happy ending.                  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...                 THE SWAMP                 ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. \'I\'m                 a Believer\' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek                 and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting                 carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet                 which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end                 up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet                 instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now                 has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona                 walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over                 singing the song.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          God bless us, every one.                                       DONKEY                          (as he\'s done singing and we fade to                           black) Oh, that\'s funny. Oh. Oh. I can\'t                           breathe. I can\'t breathe.                  THE END",,6

Existing cloud gaming systems suffer from low GPU utilization in the virtualized environment. Moreover, GPU resources are scheduled in units of virtual machines (VMs) and this kind of coarse-grained scheduling at the VM-level fails to fully exploit GPU processing capacity. ShareRender offloads graphics workloads within VMs directly to GPUs, bypassing GPU virtualization. For each game running in a VM, ShareRender starts a graphics wrapper to intercept frame rendering requests and assign them to render agents responsible for frame rendering on GPUs. Thanks to the flexible workload assignment among multiple render agents, ShareRender enables fine-grained resource sharing at the frame-level to significantly improve GPU utilization.  If you want to know more about ShareRender, please refer to our paper in Multimedia 2017.

There are mountains (Big & Small) in your way which does not allow you to drive smoothly and creates the problem of going out of fuel. Another difficulty includes mines. Mines are placed in your way and when your car hits the mine it will be thrown into the air and you have to balance the car and make stunts and land it safely. Your car will be crashed if its upper part, bumper or step bumper or trunk lids hits the ground. You have to reach as far as you can before going out of fuel. Also you are provided with boost in your way.  The amount of boost is pre-fixed. Taking the boost is the only way to cover a long distance. You are also provided with fuel tanks in your way. Another important part in the game is collection of coins while playing.","unity,game,car,racing,csharp,unityengine,play,html,coins,speed,boost,design,cross-platform,gaming,2d,3d",3

Mas ela tinha um encanto  sobre ela de um tipo assustador que poderia  ser quebrado apenas pelo primeiro beijo do amor.  Ela foi trancada num castelo guardada  por um terrível dragão que respira fogo.  Muitos cavaleiros corajosos tinham tentado  libertá-la desta horrível prisão,  mas não prevaleceram. Ela esperou no  dragão na sala mais alta de  a torre mais alta para o seu verdadeiro amor  e o primeiro beijo do verdadeiro amor. (risos)  Como se isso alguma vez viesse a acontecer. O que  uma carga de - (autoclismo) Allstar - por Smashmouth começa a jogar. Shrek faz a sua  dia. Enquanto estão numa cidade próxima, os aldeões reúnem-se para ir  depois do ogre. NOITE - PERTO DA CASA DO SHREK MAN1 Pensa que está aí? MAN2 Muito bem. Vamos a isso! MAN1 Whoa. Espera aí. Sabe o que é isso?  coisa pode fazer-lhe? MAN3 Sim, vai moer os seus ossos porque é  pão. Shrek esgueira-se para trás deles e ri-se. SHREK Sim, bem, na verdade, isso seria um  gigante. Agora, ogres, oh eles são muito piores.  Vão fazer um fato do vosso recém  pele descascada. HOMENS Não! SHREK Eles raparão o seu fígado. Aperte o  geleia dos seus olhos! Na verdade, é  bastante bom em torradas. MAN1 Voltar! Para trás, besta! Para trás! Eu aviso-vos!  (acena a tocha em Shrek). Shrek lambe calmamente os seus dedos e apaga a tocha. O  os homens encolhem-se para longe dele. O Shrek ruge muito alto e comprido  e a sua respiração extingue todas as tochas restantes até ao  os homens estão no escuro. SHREK Esta é a parte em que se foge.  (Os homens esforçam-se por fugir. Ele ri-se).  E fica de fora! (olha para baixo e escolhe  para cima de um pedaço de papel. Lê). ""Procura-se.  Criaturas de conto de fadas""(Ele suspira e  atira o papel sobre o seu ombro). O PRÓXIMO DIA Há uma linha de criaturas de contos de fadas. O chefe da guarda  senta-se numa mesa a pagar às pessoas por trazerem as criaturas dos contos de fadas  a ele. Há gaiolas por todo o lado. Algumas das pessoas na fila  são Peter Pan, que carrega Tinkerbell numa gaiola, Gipetto  que carrega Pinóquio, e um agricultor que carrega os três  porquinhos. GUARDA Muito bem. Este está cheio. Toma-a  longe! Despachem-se. Vá lá! Levantem-se! GUARDA-CHAVE Próximo! GUARDA (levando a vassoura da bruxa) Dá-me isso!  Os seus dias de voo acabaram. (quebra a  vassoura ao meio) GUARDA-CHAVE São 20 peças de prata para a bruxa.  A seguir! GUARDA Levantem-se! Vá lá! GUARDA-CHAVE Vinte peças. PEQUENAS PÉROCAS (chorando) Esta gaiola é demasiado pequena. DONKEY Por favor, não me denunciem. Eu nunca  ser teimoso de novo. Eu posso mudar. Por favor!  Dêem-me outra oportunidade! VELHA MULHER Cala-te. (sacode a sua corda) DONKEY Oh! GUARDA-CHAVE Próximo! O que é que tem? GIPETTO Este pequeno boneco de madeira. PINOCCHIO Eu não sou um fantoche. Sou um rapaz de verdade. (o seu  o nariz cresce) GUARDA-CHAVE Cinco xelins para o brinquedo possuído.  Leve-o embora. PINOCCHIO Pai, por favor! Não os deixe fazer isto!  Ajudem-me! Gipetto pega no dinheiro e vai-se embora. A mulher idosa sobe  para a mesa. GUARDA-CHAVE Próximo! O que é que tem? VELHAS MULHERES Bem, eu tenho um burro que fala. GUARDA-CHAVE Certo. Isso é bom para dez xelins,  se o conseguir provar. VELHAS MULHERES Vá em frente, pequenote. O burro apenas olha para ela. GUARDA-CHAVE Bem? VELHAS MULHERES Oh, oh, ele é apenas...ele é apenas um pouco  nervoso. Ele é realmente um tagarela e tanto.  Fala, seu boneco cabeça de osso... GUARDA-CHAVE É isso mesmo. Já ouvi o suficiente. Guardas! VELHAS MULHERES Não, não, ele fala! Ele fala. (finge  para ser burro) Posso falar. Adoro  falar. Eu sou a coisa mais falante  que alguma vez tenha visto. GUARDA-CHAVE Tirem-na da minha vista. VELHA MULHER Não, não! Eu juro! Oh! Ele pode falar! Os guardas agarram a velha mulher e ela luta com eles. Um  das suas pernas voa e chuta a Sininho de Peter Pan\'s  mãos, e a sua jaula cai sobre a cabeça do burro. Ele é polvilhado  com pó de fada e ele é capaz de voar. DONKEY Ei! eu posso voar! PETER PAN Ele pode voar! 3 PEQUENOS PORCOS Ele pode voar! GUARDA-CHAVE Ele pode falar! DONKEY Ha, ha! É isso mesmo, idiota! Agora eu sou  um burro voador e falante. Pode  ter visto uma mosca doméstica, talvez até uma super mosca  mas aposto que nunca viu um burro  voar. Ha, ha! (o pó de pixie começa  a desgastar) Uh-oh. (ele começa a afundar-se  para o solo). Atinge o chão com um estrondo. GUARDA-CHAVE Apreendam-no! (Burro tira de correr).  Atras dele!  Apreendam-no! (Burro tira de correr).  Atrás dele! GUARDS Ele está a fugir! Apanhem-no! Por aqui!  Virem-se! O burro continua a correr e acaba por se deparar com o Shrek. Literalmente.  Shrek vira-se para ver quem esbarra com ele. O burro parece assustado  por um momento, depois avista os guardas a subir o caminho. Ele  esconde-se rapidamente atrás do Shrek. GUARDA-CHAVE Você aí. Ogre! SHREK Aye? GUARDA-CHAVE Por ordem do Senhor Farquaad estou autorizado  para o colocar tanto sob prisão como sob transporte  a uma instalação de reinstalação designada. SHREK Ah, a sério? Você e que exército? Ele olha para trás da guarda e a guarda vira-se para olhar também  e vemos que os outros homens fugiram. A cauda do guarda manca  e foge. Shrek ri e volta atrás nos seus negócios e  começa a caminhar de volta para a sua cabana. DONKEY Posso dizer-vos alguma coisa? Ouça,  você era realmente, realmente, realmente qualquer coisa  aqui atrás. Incrível! SHREK Está a falar com...(ele vira-se  e o Burro desapareceu) eu? (ele volta para trás  à volta e o Burro está mesmo à frente  dele). Uau! DONKEY Sim, eu estava a falar consigo. Posso dizer  que você que você foi ótimo de volta  aqui? Esses guardas! Eles pensaram que eles  era tudo isso. Depois apareceu,  e pimba! estavam a tropeçar em si mesmos  como as crianças na floresta. Que realmente  fez-me sentir bem em ver isso. SHREK Isso é óptimo. Realmente. DONKEY Meu, é bom ser livre. SHREK Agora, porque não vais celebrar o teu  a liberdade com os seus próprios amigos? Hmm? DONKEY Mas, eu não tenho amigos. E  Não vou lá fora sozinho. Olá,  espere um minuto! Tive uma grande ideia! Eu vou  ficar convosco. Você é mau, verde,  máquina de combate. Juntos vamos assustar  o cuspo de qualquer pessoa que atravesse  nós. Shrek vira e considera o Burro por um momento antes de rugir muito  em voz alta. DONKEY Oh, uau! Isto foi realmente assustador. Se você  não se importe que eu diga, se isso não acontecer  trabalho, o seu hálito irá certamente ficar  o trabalho feito, ""porque você definitivamente  precisam de alguns Tic Tacs ou algo parecido, \'porque  o seu hálito cheira mal! Quase se queimou  os cabelos do meu nariz, tal como o  tempo...(Shrek cobre-lhe a boca mas Burro  continua a falar, por isso Shrek remove  a sua mão). ...depois comi um pouco podre  bagas. Tive fugas de gases fortes  do meu rabo nesse dia. SHREK Porque me seguem? DONKEY Eu digo-lhe porquê. (cantando) \'Cause  Estou completamente sozinho, não há ninguém aqui ao lado  eu, Os meus problemas desapareceram todos, Há  ninguém para me ridicularizar, mas é preciso ter  a fé... SHREK Parem de cantar! Não é de admirar que não  ter quaisquer amigos. DONKEY Uau. Só um verdadeiro amigo seria que  cruelmente honesto. SHREK Ouve, burrinho. Dê uma olhadela em  eu. O que sou eu? DONKEY (olha até ao topo em Shrek) Uh ...realmente  alto? SHREK Não! Eu sou um ogre! Sabem. ""Agarra o teu  tocha e forquilhas"". Não é assim?  incomodam-no? DONKEY Não. SHREK A sério? DONKEY Realmente, realmente. SHREK Oh. DONKEY Gosto de ti. Qual é o seu nome? SHREK Shrek. DONKEY Shrek? Bem, você sabe do que eu gosto em  você, Shrek? Tens esse tipo de ""eu não me importo com o que não me importo com o que não me importo com o que não me importo com o que não me importo com o que não me importo com o que não me importo  coisa. Gosto disso. Eu respeito isso,  Shrek. Está tudo bem. (Eles vêm  uma colina e pode ver a casa de campo do Shrek).  Uau! Vejam isto. Quem iria querer viver  no lugar assim? SHREK Essa seria a minha casa. DONKEY Oh! e é adorável! Simplesmente lindo.  Sabe que é um decorador e tanto.  É espantoso o que fez com tal  um orçamento modesto. Gosto desse pedregulho.  É um pedregulho agradável. Acho que você  não diverte muito, pois não?  SHREK Gosto da minha privacidade. DONKEY Eu também sei. Isso é outra coisa.  que temos em comum. Como eu odeio quando  tem alguém na sua cara. Tem  tentando dar-lhes uma dica, e eles  não se vai embora. Há aquele silêncio incómodo.  (silêncio embaraçoso) Posso ficar contigo? SHREK O quê? DONKEY Posso ficar convosco, por favor? SHREK (sarcasticamente) É claro! DONKEY A sério? SHREK Não. DONKEY Por favor! Eu não quero voltar lá!  Não sabe o que é ser  considerado uma aberração. (pausa enquanto ele  olha para Shrek) Bem, talvez o faça.  Mas é por isso que temos de nos manter unidos.  Tens de me deixar ficar! Por favor! Por favor! SHREK Muito bem! Muito bem! Mas apenas uma noite. DONKEY Ah! Obrigado! (ele corre dentro da cabana) SHREK O que é que você...? (O burro salta para cima de  uma cadeira). Não! Não! DONKEY Isto vai ser divertido! Podemos ficar de pé  tarde, trocar\' histórias masculinas, e em  de manhã estou a fazer waffles. SHREK Oh! DONKEY Onde é que eu durmo? SHREK (irritado) Lá fora! DONKEY Oh, bem, acho que isso é fixe. Quer dizer,  Eu não o conheço, e você não sabe  eu, por isso acho que lá fora é melhor, você  saiba. Aqui vou eu. Boa noite. (Shrek  bateu a porta). (suspiro) Quer dizer, eu faço  como o ar livre. Eu sou um burro. Eu era  nascidos no exterior. Estarei apenas sentado por  eu próprio lá fora, suponho, sabe. Por  eu próprio, lá fora. Estou completamente só...há  ninguém aqui ao meu lado... SHREK\'S COTTAGE - NOITE Shrek está a preparar-se para o jantar. Ele próprio se senta e acende  uma vela feita de cera dos ouvidos. Ele começa a comer quando ouve uma  ruído. Ele levanta-se com um murmúrio. SHREK (ao burro) Pensei ter-te dito para  ficar no exterior. DONKEY (a partir da janela) Estou lá fora. Há outro ruído e Shrek vira-se para encontrar a pessoa que  fez o barulho. Ele vê várias sombras a mover-se. Ele finalmente vira  e mancha 3 ratos cegos na sua mesa. BLIND MOUSE1 Bem, meus senhores, é muito longe do  quinta, mas que escolha temos nós? BLIND MOUSE2 Não é a sua casa, mas serve perfeitamente. GORDO (saltando sobre uma lesma) Que cama adorável. SHREK Apanhei-te. (Agarra um rato, mas escapa  e aterra no seu ombro). GORDO Encontrei algum queijo. (mordidas Shrek\'s  orelha) SHREK Ow! GORDO Blá! Coisas horríveis. BLIND MOUSE1 És tu, Gordo? GORDO Como é que soube? SHREK Já chega! (ele agarra os 3 ratos) O que são  que fazes em minha casa? (Ele é esbarrado  por trás e deixa cair os ratos).  Ei! (ele vira-se e vê os Sete Anões  com a Branca de Neve sobre a mesa). Oh, não,  não, não. Morto largo fora da mesa. DWARF Onde é que a devemos colocar? O  A cama está ocupada. SHREK Huh? Shrek marcha até ao quarto e atira a cortina para trás.  O Grande Lobo Mau está sentado na cama. O lobo olha apenas para  ele. MUITO MAIOR LÚPIDO O quê? TEMPO LAPSE Shrek tem agora o Grande Lobo Mau pelo colarinho e está a arrastar-se  ele para a porta da frente. SHREK Vivo num pântano. Coloco sinais. Eu sou  um ogre aterrador! O que é que eu tenho de fazer?  consegue um pouco de privacidade? (Ele abre o  porta da frente para expulsar o Lobo e  ele vê que todas as Fadas recolhidas  As criaturas contadas estão na sua terra). Oh,  não. Não! Não! Os 3 ursos sentam-se à volta da fogueira, o flautista de peluche está a tocar o seu  e os ratos estão todos a correr para ele, alguns duendes estão a dirigir  tráfego aéreo para que as fadas e bruxas possam aterrar...etc. SHREK O que estás a fazer no meu pântano? (isto  ecoa e todos se calam). Ouvem-se os estertores a toda a volta. As 3 boas fadas escondem-se dentro de um  tenda. SHREK Muito bem, saiam daqui. Todos vocês,  mexam-se! Vá lá! Vamos! Hapaya!  Hapaya! Hey! Depressa! Vamos lá! (mais  anões correm dentro de casa) Não, não!  Não, não! Não, não! Aí não. (eles  fecha-lhe a porta) Oh! (vira-se para  olhar para Burro) DONKEY Não olhes para mim. Eu não convidei  eles. PINOCCHIO Meu Deus, ninguém nos convidou. SHREK O quê? PINOCCHIO Fomos forçados a vir aqui. SHREK (aturdido) Por quem? PEQUENO PORCO Lorde Farquaad. Ele bufou e soprou  e ele...assinou um aviso de despejo. SHREK (suspiro pesado) Muito bem. Quem sabe onde  este tipo Farquaad é? Todos olham uns para os outros, mas ninguém responde. DONKEY Ai sim. Eu sei onde ele está. SHREK Alguém mais sabe onde encontrar  ele? Alguém?  DONKEY Eu! Eu! SHREK Alguém? DONKEY Oh! Oh, escolhe-me! Oh, eu sei! Eu sei!  Eu, eu, eu! SHREK (suspiro) Está bem, óptimo. Atenção, todas as fadas  coisas de contos. Não se sinta à vontade.  O seu acolhimento está oficialmente desgastado.  De facto, vou ver este tipo, Farquaad  agora mesmo e tirar-vos a todos da minha terra  e de volta de onde veio! (Pausa.  Depois a multidão fica selvagem). Oh! (para Burro)  Você! Tu vens comigo. DONKEY Muito bem, é isso que eu gosto de ouvir,  homem. Shrek e Burro, dois robôs  amigos, fora num redemoinho da grande cidade  aventura. Adoro-a! DONKEY (cantando) Na estrada novamente. Cantem-no  comigo, Shrek. Mal posso esperar para ter  na estrada novamente. SHREK O que é que eu disse sobre cantar? DONKEY Posso assobiar? SHREK Não. DONKEY Posso cantarolar? SHREK Muito bem, cantarolar. O burro começa a cantarolar \'On the Road Again\'. DULOC - COZINHA Um homem mascarado está a torturar o Homem Pão de Gengibre. Ele está continuamente  a mergulhá-lo num copo de leite. O Senhor Farquaad entra. FARQUAAD Já é suficiente. Ele está pronto para falar. O Homem Pão de Gengibre é arrancado do leite e batido  numa folha de bolacha. Farquaad ri-se enquanto caminha para a  mesa. No entanto, quando ele chega à mesa, vemos que ela vai  até aos seus olhos. Ele limpa a garganta e a mesa é abaixada. FARQUAAD (ele pega nas pernas do Homem Pão de Gengibre  e brinca com eles) Corre, corre, corre, corre,  o mais rápido que puder. Não se pode apanhar  eu. Eu sou o homem do pão de gengibre. O HOMEM DO PÃO DE GENGIBRE Você é um monstro. FARQUAAD Eu não sou o monstro aqui. Você é que é. Vós  e o resto desse lixo de conto de fadas,  envenenando o meu mundo perfeito. Agora, diga  eu! Onde estão os outros? HOMEM DE PÃO DE GENGIBRE Comam-me! (Ele cospe leite no Farquaad\'s  olho). FARQUAAD Tentei ser justo para convosco, criaturas.  Agora a minha paciência chegou ao fim!  Digam-me ou eu...(ele faz como se  puxar os botões do Gingerbread Man) HOMEM DE PÃO DE GENGIBRE Não, não, não os botões. Não, não, não os botões.  botões. FARQUAAD Muito bem, então. Quem os está a esconder? O HOMEM DO PÃO DE GENGIBRE Está bem, eu digo-vos. Conhece o  homem muffin? FARQUAAD O homem dos muffins? O HOMEM DOS BOLOS DE GENGIBRE O homem dos muffins. FARQUAAD Sim, eu conheço o homem que come bolos, que vive  em Drury Lane? HOMEM DE PÃO DE GENGIBRE Bem, ela é casada com o homem dos muffins. FARQUAAD O homem dos muffins? O HOMEM DOS BOLOS DE GENGIBRE O homem dos muffins! FARQUAAD Ela é casada com o homem dos muffins. A porta abre-se e a Guarda-Chefe entra. GUARDA-CHAVE Meu senhor! Encontrámo-lo. FARQUAAD Então de que é que está à espera? Traga  em. Mais guardas entram carregando algo que é coberto por um lençol.  Desligam o que quer que seja e retiram o lençol. É a Magia  Espelho. HOMEM PÃO DE GENGIBRE (em pavor) Ohhhhh... FARQUAAD Espelho mágico... HOMEM PÃO DE GENGIBRE Não lhe digas nada! (Escolhas do Farquaad  ele e atira-o para um caixote do lixo  com uma tampa). Não! FARQUAAD Boa noite. Espelho, espelho na parede.  Não é este o reino mais perfeito?  de todos eles? MIRROR Bem, tecnicamente não se é um rei. FARQUAAD Thelonius. (Thelonius retém um  espelho de mão e esmaga-o com o seu  punho). Estava a dizer? MIRROR O que eu quero dizer é que ainda não é um rei.  Mas podes tornar-te um. Tudo o que tens  a fazer é casar com uma princesa. FARQUAAD Continuar. MIRROR (ri-se nervosamente) Por isso, sente-se  e relaxe, meu senhor, porque está na hora  para que possa conhecer as solteiras elegíveis de hoje.  E aqui estão eles! Número de solteira  um é um indivíduo mentalmente abusado de  um reino distante, distante. Ela gosta de sushi  e banhos quentes em qualquer altura. Os seus passatempos  incluem cozinhar e limpar para ela  duas irmãs más. Por favor, dêem as boas-vindas à Cinderela.  (mostra foto da Cinderela) Solteira  número dois é uma rapariga que usa capa de  a terra da fantasia. Embora ela viva  com outros sete homens, ela não é fácil.  Basta beijar-lhe os lábios mortos e congelados e  descubra o fio vivo que ela é. Venha  em. Uma salva de palmas para a Branca de Neve! (mostra  imagem da Branca de Neve) E por último, mas  certamente não último, número de solteira  três é uma ruiva ardente de um dragão guardado  castelo rodeado de lava quente a ferver!  Mas não deixes que isso te arrefeça. Ela é  uma pistola carregada que gosta de pina colads  e ser apanhado pela chuva. O seu  para o salvamento, Princesa Fiona! (Espectáculos  foto da Princesa Fiona) Assim o fará  ser solteira número um, solteira  número dois ou solteira número três?  GUARDS Dois! Dois! Três! Três! Dois! Dois! Três! FARQUAAD Três? Um? Três? THELONIUS Três! (segura 2 dedos) Número de levantamento  três, meu senhor! FARQUAAD Ok, ok, uh, número três! MIRROR Senhor Farquaad, escolheu a Princesa  Fiona. FARQUAAD Princesa Fiona. Ela é perfeita. Tudo I  tem de fazer é apenas encontrar alguém que  pode ir... MIRROR Mas provavelmente deveria mencionar o pouco  coisa que acontece à noite. FARQUAAD Eu faço-o. MIRROR Sim, mas depois do pôr-do-sol... FARQUAAD Silêncio! Vou fazer desta Princesa Fiona  minha rainha, e DuLoc terá finalmente  o rei perfeito! Capitão, reunir  os seus melhores homens. Vamos ter  um torneio. (sorri mal) Estacionamento DuLoc - Secção Lancelot O Shrek e o Burro saem do campo mesmo junto ao parque de estacionamento  lote. O próprio castelo tem cerca de 40 andares de altura. DONKEY Mas é só isso. É isso mesmo.  Isso é DuLoc. Eu disse-te que o encontraria. SHREK Portanto, esse deve ser o castelo do Lorde Farquaad. DONKEY Uh-huh. Esse é o lugar. SHREK Acha que talvez ele esteja a compensar  por alguma coisa? (Ele ri-se, mas depois  geme como o burro não percebe a piada.  Ele continua a andar pelo parque de estacionamento  lote). DONKEY Ei, esperem. Espera, Shrek. MAN Rápido, querida. Estamos atrasados. Despacha-te. SHREK Ei, você! (O atendente, que está a usar  uma cabeça gigante que se parece com o Lorde Farquaad,  grita e começa a correr através do  filas de corda para chegar ao portão da frente  para se afastar do Shrek). Espera um segundo.  Olha, não te vou comer. Eu só  - Eu apenas - - (Ele suspira e depois começa  caminhando em linha recta através das filas. O  o atendente corre contra uma parede e cai  para baixo. Shrek e Burro olham então para ele  continuar em DuLoc). DULOC Olham à sua volta, mas tudo está calmo. SHREK É sossegado. Demasiado sossegado. Onde está toda a gente? DONKEY Ei, olha para isto! O burro passa por cima e puxa uma alavanca que está presa a uma caixa  marcado \'Informação\'. A música acaba e depois as portas da caixa  abrir-se. Há pouca gente de madeira no interior e eles começam  para cantar. PESSOAS DE MADEIRA Bem-vindo à DuLoc, uma cidade tão perfeita Aqui temos algumas regras Deixe-nos estabelecê-los Não faça ondas, mantenha-se na linha E vamos dar-nos bem DuLoc é o lugar perfeito Por favor mantenha-se afastado da relva Brilha os teus sapatos, limpa a tua... cara DuLoc é, DuLoc é DuLoc é o lugar perfeito. De repente, uma câmara tira a fotografia de Burro e Shrek. DONKEY Uau! Vamos fazer isso outra vez! (prepare-se  para atropelar e puxar novamente a alavanca) SHREK (agarra a cauda do burro e segura-o imóvel)  Não. Não, não, não! Não. Eles ouvem uma fanfarra de trompete e dirigem-se para a arena. FARQUAAD Bravos cavaleiros. Vocês são os melhores e  mais brilhante em toda a terra. Hoje um  de vós provará o seu valor... Enquanto Shrek e Burro descem o túnel para entrar na arena  O burro está a cantarolar a canção temática DuLoc. SHREK Muito bem. Está a ir na direcção certa  para um fundo batido. DONKEY Desculpem por isso. FARQUAAD Aquele campeão terá a honra -  - não, não - - - o privilégio de ir em frente  e resgatar a adorável princesa Fiona  da ardente guarda do dragão. Se  por qualquer razão, o vencedor não é bem sucedido,  o primeiro segundo classificado ocupará o seu lugar  e assim por diante e assim por diante. Alguns de vós  pode morrer, mas é um sacrifício que estou disposto a fazer  a fazer. (aplausos) Que o torneio  comecem! (Ele nota Shrek) Oh! o que é  que? É hediondo! SHREK (vira-se para olhar para o burro e depois volta  em Farquaad) Ah, isso não é muito agradável.  É apenas um burro. FARQUAAD De facto. Cavaleiros, novo plano! Aquele que  mata o ogre será nomeado campeão!  Tenham-no! HOMENS Apanhem-no! SHREK Oh, ei! Agora vamos lá! Segurem-se agora. (solavancos  para uma mesa onde há canecas de  cerveja) CROWD Vá em frente! Apanhem-no! SHREK (segura uma caneca de cerveja) Não podemos simplesmente  resolver isto por uma pinta?  CROWD Matem a besta! SHREK Não? Muito bem, então. (bebe a cerveja)  Vá lá! Tira a caneca e esmaga o espigão do barril grande  de cerveja atrás dele. A cerveja vem a correr encharcar o  outros homens e a molhar o chão. Agora é como a lama. Deslizamentos de sucata  passando pelos homens e pegando numa lança que um dos homens largou.  Enquanto Shrek começa a combater o Burro salta para cima de um dos maiores  barris de cerveja. Liberta-se das suas cordas e começa a rolar.  O burro consegue esmagar dois homens na lama. Há tanto  A luta que aqui se trava não vou entrar em pormenores. Suficiente  para dizer que o Shrek dá uma tareia. DONKEY Ei, Shrek, marca-me! Marcar-me! Shrek aparece e bate com a cabeça de um homem contra os burros. Shrek  levanta-se nas cordas e interage com a multidão. SHREK Sim! Um homem tenta esgueirar-se atrás do Shrek, mas o Shrek vira-se a tempo  e vê-lo. MULHER A cadeira! Dêem-lhe a cadeira! Shrek esmaga uma cadeira sobre as costas dos rapazes. Finalmente todos os homens  estão em baixo. O burro chuta um deles no capacete, e o ding  soa o fim da partida. O público enlouquece. SHREK Oh, sim! Ah! Ah! Obrigado! Obrigado!  muito! Estou aqui até quinta-feira. Experimente  a vitela! Ha, ha! (risos) As gargalhadas param quando todos os guardas ligam as suas armas  Shrek. GUARDA-CHAVE Devo dar a ordem? FARQUAAD Não, eu tenho uma ideia melhor. Pessoas de  DuLoc, apresento-vos o nosso campeão! SHREK O quê? FARQUAAD Parabéns, ogre. Ganhou o  honra de embarcar num grande e nobre  busca. SHREK Quest? Eu já estou numa missão, uma missão  para recuperar o meu pântano. FARQUAAD O seu pântano? SHREK Sim, o meu pântano! Onde se deitaram aqueles  criaturas de contos de fadas! FARQUAAD De facto. Muito bem, ogre. Eu faço-te  um acordo. Continuar esta busca por mim, e  Eu devolvo-lhe o seu pântano. SHREK Exactamente como era? FARQUAAD Até ao último cogumelo de cobertura fina. SHREK E os agachados? FARQUAAD Tão bom como ter ido embora. SHREK Que tipo de busca? Lapso de tempo - Burro e Shrek estão agora a caminhar pelo campo  a afastar-se da DuLoc. Shrek está a mastigar uma cebola. DONKEY Deixem-me ver se entendi bem isto. Vai  ir combater um dragão e salvar uma princesa  só para que Farquaad lhe devolva  um pântano que só não se tem porque  ele encheu-a de aberrações no primeiro  lugar. Será isso correcto? SHREK Sabe, talvez haja uma boa razão  os burros não devem falar. DONKEY Não percebo. Porque é que não puxa  algumas daquelas coisas de ogre nele? Acelerador  ele, sitiar a sua fortaleza, moer  os seus ossos para fazer o seu pão, o todo  viagem dos ogros. SHREK Oh, eu sei o quê. Talvez eu pudesse ter  decapitou uma aldeia inteira e pôs  as suas cabeças num lúcio, apanharam uma faca,  abrir-lhes o baço e beber os seus  fluidos. Isto soa-lhe bem? DONKEY Uh, não, nem por isso, não. SHREK Para sua informação, há muito  mais a ogres do que as pessoas pensam. DONKEY Exemplo? SHREK Exemplo? Certo, os ogres são como cebolas.  (ele estende a sua cebola) DONKEY (fareja a cebola) Cheiram mal? SHREK Sim - - Não! DONKEY Fazem-no chorar? SHREK Não! DONKEY Deixamo-los ao sol, eles ficam  todo castanho, começar a brotar pouco branco  pêlos. SHREK Não! Camadas! As cebolas têm camadas. Ogres  ter camadas! As cebolas têm camadas. Você  perceber? Ambos temos camadas. (ele tece  um suspiro e depois sai a pé) DONKEY (a seguir ao Shrek) Oh, vocês os dois  têm camadas. Oh. {Sniffs} Sabe,  nem toda a gente gosta de cebolas. Bolo! Toda a gente  adora bolos! Os bolos têm camadas. SHREK Não me interessa... o que todos gostam.  Os ogres não são como os bolos. DONKEY Sabe do que mais todos gostam?  Parfaits. Alguma vez conheceu uma pessoa,  você diz: ""Vamos buscar algum parfait"", eles  dizer: ""Diabos, não, não gosto de nenhum parfait""?  Os parfaits são deliciosos. SHREK Não! você denso, irritante, miniatura  besta de carga! Os ogros são como cebolas!  E da história. Adeusinho. Vejo-vos mais tarde.  DONKEY Os parfaits podem ser a coisa mais deliciosa  em todo o maldito planeta. SHREK Acho que preferia o seu zumbido. DONKEY Tem um lenço de papel ou algo assim? Eu tenho  a fazer uma confusão. Apenas a palavra parfait  fazer-me começar a babar. Eles partem. Há uma montagem da sua viagem. Caminhando por  um campo ao pôr-do-sol. Dormir debaixo de uma lua brilhante. Tentar Shrek  para apagar a fogueira no dia seguinte e ter um pouco de problema,  por isso, o burro faz chichi no fogo para o apagar. KEEP DO DRAGON O Shrek e o Burro estão a caminhar até à Fortaleza que é suposto  casa Princesa Fiona. Parece parecer-se com um vulcão gigante. DONKEY Ohh! Shrek! Foste tu que fizeste isso?  Tens de avisar alguém antes de  decifrar uma. A minha boca estava aberta e  tudo. SHREK Acredita em mim, Burro, se fosse eu, tu  estar morto. (farejos) É enxofre. Nós  deve estar a aproximar-se. DONKEY Sim, certo, enxofre. Não fale  sobre é o enxofre. Eu sei o que  Cheira-me mal. Não era enxofre. É  também não saiu de pedra nenhuma. Sobem pelo lado do vulcão/gave e olham para baixo. Ali  é um pequeno pedaço de rocha mesmo no centro e é aí  o castelo está. Está rodeado de lava fervente. Parece muito  vaticínio. SHREK Claro, é suficientemente grande, mas olha para a  localização. (risos...depois o riso vira-se  num gemido) DONKEY Uh, Shrek? Uh, lembra-se quando disse  ogres têm camadas? SHREK Ah, sim. DONKEY Bem, tenho uma pequena confissão a  marca. Os burros não têm camadas. Nós  usar o nosso medo mesmo ali fora no nosso  mangas. SHREK Espere um segundo. Os burros não têm mangas. DONKEY Sabe o que quero dizer. SHREK Não se pode dizer que se tem medo das alturas. DONKEY Não, estou apenas um pouco desconfortável  sobre estar sobre uma ponte raquítica sobre  uma ebulição como a da lava! SHREK Vá lá, Burro. Estou aqui mesmo ao lado de  ya, está bem? Para apoio emocional, nós  basta enfrentar esta coisa em conjunto  pequeno passo de bebé de cada vez. DONKEY A sério? SHREK Realmente, realmente. DONKEY Ok, isso faz-me sentir muito melhor. SHREK Continue a andar. E não olhe para baixo. DONKEY Está bem, não olhes para baixo. Não olhes para baixo.  Não olhes para baixo. Continua a andar. Não  olhar para baixo. (ele pisa através de uma podridão  e acaba por olhar directamente para baixo  para a lava) Shrek! Estou a olhar para baixo!  Oh, Deus, não consigo fazer isto! Deixa-me só  desligado, por favor! SHREK Mas já está a meio caminho. DONKEY Mas eu sei que metade é segura! SHREK Está bem, pronto. Não tenho tempo para isto.  Volte atrás. DONKEY Shrek, não! Espera! SHREK Só, Burro - - Vamos fazer uma dança  então, será que eu? (salta e balança o  ponte) DONKEY Não faça isso! SHREK Oh, desculpe. Fazer o quê? Oh, isto? (salta  a ponte novamente) DONKEY Sim, isso! SHREK Sim? Sim, fá-lo. Está bem. (continua a  saltar e balançar enquanto ele faz a travessia de burro  a ponte)  DONKEY Não, Shrek! Não! Parem com isso! SHREK Disse para o fazer! Faço-o. DONKEY Vou morrer. Eu vou morrer. Shrek,  Vou morrer. (passos em terra firme)  Oh! SHREK Já chega, Burro. Isso serve. (caminhadas  em direcção ao castelo) DONKEY Fixe. Então onde é que está este fogo  dor no pescoço de qualquer maneira? SHREK Lá dentro, à espera que a resgatássemos.  (risos) DONKEY Eu estava a falar do dragão, Shrek. DENTRO DO CASTELO DONKEY Está com medo? SHREK Não. DONKEY Mas... SHREK Shh. DONKEY Óptimo. Eu também não. (vê um esqueleto  e arfadas) ""Porque não há nada de errado"".  com medo. O medo é sensato  resposta a uma situação desconhecida.  Uma situação perigosa desconhecida, eu poderia  acrescentar. Com um dragão que respira fogo  e come cavaleiros e respira fogo,  não significa de certeza que seja um cobarde  se estiver um pouco assustado. Tenho a certeza como  não é nenhum cobarde. Eu sei disso. SHREK Burro, duas coisas, está bem? Cala-te... para cima.  Agora vai até lá e vê se consegues  encontrar qualquer escada. DONKEY Escadas? Pensei que estávamos à procura de  a princesa. SHREK (colocando um capacete) A princesa irá  subir as escadas na sala mais alta  na torre mais alta. DONKEY O que o faz pensar que ela vai lá estar? SHREK Li uma vez num livro. (sai a pé) DONKEY Fixe. Maneja o dragão. Eu trato de  as escadas. Vou encontrar essas escadas.  Também lhes darei chicotadas no rabo. Aquelas escadas  não saberão para que lado vão.  (sai a pé) SALA DE VAZIO O burro ainda está a falar sozinho enquanto olha à volta da sala. DONKEY Vou tomar medidas drásticas. Chute-a  para o passeio. Não se metam comigo. Eu sou  o mestre das escadas. Eu dominei o  escadas. Quem me dera ter um degrau aqui mesmo.  Pisaria em cima dele. ELSEWHERE Shrek mancha uma luz na janela da torre mais alta. SHREK Bem, pelo menos sabemos onde está a princesa  é, mas onde está o... DONKEY (os) Dragão! O burro arfa e descola correndo enquanto o dragão ruge novamente.  Shrek consegue tirar o burro do caminho tal como o dragão  respira fogo. SHREK Burro, cuidado! (ele consegue obter  um porão da cauda dos dragões e porões  on) Apanhei-te! O dragão fica irritado com isto e mexe a sua cauda e Shrek  vai voando pelo ar e cai pelo telhado do  a torre mais alta. Fiona acorda com um idiota e olha para ele deitado  no chão. DONKEY Oh! Aah! Aah! O burro é encurralado enquanto o Dragão deita tudo a perder, menos um pequeno  parte da ponte em que ele está. DONKEY Não, não, não! (o dragão ruge) Oh,  que dentes grandes tem. (o dragão  rosnados) Quero dizer dentes brancos, brilhantes.  Eu sei que provavelmente ouvem isto o tempo todo  da sua comida, mas deve ser branqueado,  porque isso é um sorriso deslumbrante  chegou lá. Detecto uma pitada de menta  frescura? E sabe o que mais? Você é  - És uma rapariga dragão! Oh, claro!  É claro que és uma rapariga dragão.  Apenas tresanda a beleza feminina.  (o dragão começa a agitar os seus olhos  a ele) O que é que se passa consigo?  Tem algo no seu olho? Ohh.  Oh. Oh. Meu, adorava mesmo ficar,  mas sabe, eu sou, uh...(o dragão  sopra um anel de fumo com a forma de um  coração para ele, e ele tosse) Eu estou  um asmático, e não sei se seria  fazer exercício se vai soprar fumo  anéis. Shrek! (o dragão escolhe-o  com os seus dentes e carrega-o)  Não! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! SALA DA FIONA Shrek geme quando se levanta do chão. As suas costas estão para a Fiona  por isso endireita o vestido e deita-se de novo na cama. Ela  depois chega rapidamente ao fim e tira o ramo de flores  a mesa lateral. Ela deita-se então e parece estar a dormir.  Shrek vira-se e dirige-se a ela. Ele olha para Fiona para  um momento e ela enfia os lábios. Shrek leva-a pelos ombros  e sacode-a. FIONA Oh! Oh! SHREK Acorda! FIONA O quê? SHREK É a Princesa Fiona? FIONA Estou, à espera de um cavaleiro tão ousado a ponto de  salvar-me. SHREK Oh, isso é bom. Agora, vamos! FIONA Mas espere, Sir Knight. Isto é... com o nosso  primeira reunião. Não deveria ser uma maravilha,  momento romântico? SHREK Sim, desculpe, senhora. Não há tempo. FIONA Ei, esperem. O que estás a fazer? Deveria  varrer-me da janela para fora  e desça uma corda sobre o seu corcel valente.  SHREK Teve muito tempo para planear isto,  não o fez? FIONA (sorrisos) Mm-hmm. Shrek parte a fechadura da sua porta e puxa-a para fora e para baixo  o corredor. FIONA Mas temos de saborear este momento! Você  poderia recitar um poema épico para mim. A  balada? Um soneto! Um limerick? Ou algo assim! SHREK Não me parece. FIONA Posso ao menos saber o nome do meu campeão? SHREK Shrek. FIONA Sir Shrek. (limpa a garganta e segura  de um lenço) Rezo para que  Aceite este favor como um sinal da minha gratidão. SHREK Obrigado! De repente, ouvem o rugido do dragão. FIONA (surpreendido)Não matou o dragão? SHREK Está na minha lista de afazeres. Agora vamos lá!  (arranca a correr e arrasta a Fiona para trás  ele). FIONA Mas isto não está certo! Estavas destinado a  para carregar, espada desembainhada, bandeira voando.  Foi o que todos os outros cavaleiros fizeram. SHREK Sim, mesmo antes de rebentarem em chamas. FIONA Não é essa a questão. (Shrek de repente  pára e ela esbarra nele). Oh! (Shrek  ignora-a e dirige-se para uma porta de madeira  para o lado). Esperar. Onde estás  a ir? A saída é por ali. SHREK Bem, tenho de salvar a minha pele. FIONA Que tipo de cavaleiro é você? SHREK Único. (abre a porta para  a sala do trono) DONKEY (os) Abrandar. Mais devagar, querida, por favor.  Creio que é saudável conhecer  alguém durante um longo período de tempo.  Chamem-me apenas antiquado. (risos  preocupantemente) (vemo-lo de perto e  à distância enquanto o Shrek se esgueira para  a sala) Não quero apressar-me a  uma relação física. Não estou emocionalmente  pronto para um compromisso de, uh, isto  - Magnitude é realmente a palavra que eu sou  à procura. Magnitude- - Ei, que  é o contacto físico indesejado. Ei, o que  está a fazer? Está bem, está bem. Vamos apenas  recuar um pouco e dar este passo  de cada vez. Deveríamos realmente conhecer  uns aos outros primeiro como amigos ou amigos por correspondência.  Estou na estrada muitas vezes, mas simplesmente adoro  recepção de cartões - - Eu adoraria mesmo  para ficar, mas - - Não faça isso! Isso é  a minha cauda! Essa é a minha cauda pessoal. Tu és  vai rasgá-lo. Eu não dou permissão  - O que é que vai fazer com isso?  Ei, agora. Nem pensar. Não! Não! Não, não! Não.  Não, não, não! Não! Não! Shrek agarra uma corrente que está ligada ao candelabro e balança  em direcção ao dragão. Ele falha e volta a baloiçar. Ele olha  e manchas que o candelabro está mesmo por cima da cabeça dos dragões.  Ele puxa a corrente e esta solta-se e ele cai e choca  Burro fora do caminho certo como o dragão está prestes a beijá-lo.  Em vez disso, o dragão beija o rabo do Shreks. Ela abre os olhos e  rugidos. Shrek solta a corrente e o candelabro cai sobre  a cabeça dela, mas é demasiado grande e passa-lhe por cima da cabeça e das formas  uma espécie de colarinho para ela. Ela ruge novamente e Shrek e Burro  descolar a correr. Estilo muito \'Matrix\'. Shrek agarra o burro e  depois agarra a Princesa Fiona enquanto corre ao seu lado. DONKEY Olá, Princesa! FIONA Fala! SHREK Sim, está a fazê-lo calar-se que é  o truque. Todos eles começam a gritar à medida que o dragão ganha com eles. Manchas de retalhamento  um escorrega descendente e salta. Mas infelizmente há um  racha na pedra e atinge o Shrek mesmo na virilha. A sua  os olhos cruzam-se e ao chegar ao fundo do escorrega tropeça  e caminha ligeiramente. SHREK Oh! Shrek aproxima-os da saída e põe o Burro e a Fiona no chão. SHREK Muito bem, vocês os dois, ouvidos para a saída! Eu vou  tomar conta do dragão. Shrek agarra numa espada e volta para o interior do  castelo. Ele atira a espada para o chão entre várias sobreposições  elos da cadeia. Os elos da cadeia estão ligados ao candelabro que  ainda está à volta do pescoço dos dragões. SHREK (ecoando) Corre! Todos eles partem a correr para a saída com o dragão em brasa  perseguição. Conseguem chegar à ponte e atravessar. Os dragões  respira fogo e a ponte começa a arder. Todos eles se agarram  para a querida vida, à medida que as cordas que seguram a ponte se desmoronam. Eles  são balançados para o outro lado. Ao pendurarem-se de cabeça para baixo, parecem  de horror como o dragão faz para sobrevoar a lava fervente para  obtê-los. Mas de repente o candelabro com a corrente sacode o  dragão de volta e ela não consegue chegar até eles. O nosso bando trepa  rapidamente para a segurança enquanto o dragão parece zangado e depois dá um  lamúrias tristes enquanto observa o burro a afastar-se.  FIONA (deslizando pela colina \'vulcânica\') Você  conseguiu! Salvaste-me! És espantoso!  (atrás do seu burro cai pela colina abaixo)  Você é - - Você é maravilhoso. Você é - - Você é...  (vira e vê o Shrek a cair no  colina e esbarrar no burro) um pouco  não ortodoxo, admito. Mas a tua escritura  é grande, e o teu coração é puro. Eu sou  eternamente em dívida. (O burro limpa  a sua garganta). E onde é que um corajoso  cavaleiro estar sem o seu nobre corcel? DONKEY Espero que tenha ouvido isso. Ela chamou-me  um nobre corcel. Ela pensa que eu sou um corcel. FIONA A batalha está ganha. Pode remover a sua  capacete, bom Sir Knight. SHREK Uh, não. FIONA Porque não? SHREK Tenho cabelo de capacete. FIONA Por favor. Eu olharia para a cara  do meu socorrista. SHREK Não, não, não o faria - - \'st. FIONA Mas como é que me beijará? SHREK O quê? (ao burro) Que não estava no  descrição das funções. DONKEY Talvez seja uma prerrogativa. FIONA Não, é o destino. Oh, deve saber  como vai. Uma princesa fechada numa  torre e assolada por um dragão é resgatada  por um cavaleiro corajoso, e depois partilham  o primeiro beijo do verdadeiro amor. DONKEY Hmm? Com Shrek? Você pensa... - Espere.  Espera. Pensas que o Shrek é verdade  amor? FIONA Bem, sim. Tanto o Burro como o Shrek desataram a rir. DONKEY Pensa que Shrek é o seu verdadeiro amor! FIONA O que é tão engraçado? SHREK Digamos que não sou o teu tipo, está bem? Fiona:  Claro que és. Tu és o meu salvador.  Agora - - Agora retira o teu capacete. SHREK Veja. Realmente não acho que isto seja um  boa ideia. FIONA Basta tirar o capacete. SHREK Não o vou fazer. FIONA Tire-o. SHREK Não! FIONA Agora! SHREK Muito bem! Fácil. Como ordenar. Vossa Alteza.  (tira-lhe o capacete) FIONA Você... - Você é... - um ogre. SHREK Estava à espera do Príncipe Encantado. FIONA Bem, sim, na verdade. Oh, não. Isto é  tudo errado. Não é suposto estar  um ogre. SHREK Princesa, fui enviado para te salvar por  Lorde Farquaad, está bem? Ele é aquele que  quer casar consigo. FIONA Então porque não veio ele salvar-me? SHREK Boa pergunta. Deveria perguntar-lhe que  quando lá chegarmos. FIONA Mas tenho de ser resgatado pela minha verdadeira  amor, não por algum ogro e o seu... - o seu  animal de estimação. DONKEY Bem, tanto para o nobre corcel. SHREK Não estás a facilitar o meu trabalho. FIONA Lamento, mas o seu trabalho não é problema meu.  Podeis dizer ao Senhor Farquaad que se ele  quer salvar-me devidamente, eu serei  esperando por ele aqui mesmo. SHREK Ei! não sou o menino mensageiro de ninguém, todos  certo? (ominoso) Eu sou um rapaz de entregas.  (ele apanha-a rapidamente e baloiça  ela sobre o seu ombro como se fosse uma  saco de batatas) FIONA Não se atreveria. Ponham-me no chão! SHREK Já vens, Burro? DONKEY Estou mesmo atrás de si. FIONA Ponha-me no chão, ou sofrerá o  consequências! Isto não é digno!  Ponham-me no chão!  MADEIRA Passou um pouco de tempo e a Fiona acalmou. Ela apenas  fica ali coxeia enquanto Shrek a transporta. DONKEY Ok, então aqui vai outra pergunta. Diz  há uma mulher que o escava, certo,  mas não gosta muito dela dessa maneira.  Como é que a desiludem tão facilmente?  os seus sentimentos não são feridos, mas você não  ser queimado e comido? FIONA Basta dizer-lhe que ela não é a sua verdadeira  o amor. Todos sabem o que acontece quando  encontra o seu...(Shrek deixa-a cair em  o chão) Ei! quanto mais cedo chegarmos a  DuLoc o melhor. DONKEY Vai adorar lá, Princesa.  É lindo! FIONA E o que dizer do meu futuro noivo? Lorde Farquaad?  Como é que ele é? SHREK Deixe-me pôr as coisas desta forma, Princesa. Homens  da estatura de Farquaad estão em falta.  (ele e o Burro riem-se) Shrek procede então à projecção de água no seu rosto para se lavar  o pó e a sujidade. DONKEY Não sei. Há aqueles que pensam  pouco dele. (eles riem-se de novo) Fiona:  Parem com isso. Parem com isso, ambos. Vocês são  apenas ciúmes nunca se pode medir  a um grande governante como Lorde Farquaad. SHREK Sim, bem, talvez tenhas razão, Princesa.  Mas vou deixar-te fazer a ""medição"".  quando o vir amanhã. FIONA (olha para o pôr-do-sol) Amanhã?  Vai demorar assim tanto tempo? Não deveríamos parar  para fazer acampamento? SHREK Não, isso vai demorar mais tempo. Podemos manter  a ir. FIONA Mas há assaltantes na floresta. DONKEY Whoa! Desconto de tempo, Shrek! O acampamento está a começar  para soar bem. SHREK Vá lá. Sou mais assustador do que tudo  que vamos ver nesta floresta. FIONA Preciso de encontrar um lugar para acampar agora! Tanto as orelhas de Burro como as de Shrek baixam à medida que se afastam dela. MOUNTAIN CLIFF Shrek encontrou uma caverna que parece estar em boa ordem. Ele empurra  uma rocha de pedra fora do caminho para revelar a caverna. SHREK Ei! por aqui. DONKEY Shrek, podemos fazer melhor do que isso. I  não pense que isto é adequado para uma princesa. FIONA Não, não, é perfeito. Só precisa de  alguns toques caseiros. SHREK Toques caseiros? Como o quê? (ele ouve  um ruído de rasgar e olha para a Fiona  que tenha arrancado a casca de uma árvore). FIONA Uma porta? Bem, cavalheiros, eu peço-vos  boa noite. (vai para a caverna e  coloca a porta da casca atrás dela) DONKEY Quer que eu lhe leia uma história para dormir?  Vou ler. FIONA (os) Eu disse boa noite! Shrek olha para Burro por um segundo e depois vai para mover o  rochedo de volta à entrada da caverna com Fiona  ainda lá dentro. DONKEY Shrek, O que estás a fazer? SHREK (risos) Eu só... - Você sabe - - - Oh,  vamos lá. Estava só a brincar. MAIS TARDE NESSA NOITE Shrek e Burro estão sentados à volta de uma fogueira de campismo. Eles estão a olhar fixamente  para o céu enquanto Shrek aponta certas constelações de estrelas  ao burro. SHREK E, esse, esse é o Throwback,  o único ogro que alguma vez cuspiu mais de três  campos de trigo. DONKEY Certo. Sim. Ei, podes dizer o meu futuro  destas estrelas? SHREK As estrelas não dizem o futuro, Burro.  Elas contam histórias. Olha, ali está o Bloodnut,  a Flatulent. Pode adivinhar o que ele é  famoso por. DONKEY Eu sei que estás a inventar isto. SHREK Não, veja. Ali está ele, e ali está o  grupo de caçadores que fogem do seu  fedor. DONKEY Isso não é nada mais do que um monte de pequenos  pontos. SHREK Sabe, Burro, às vezes as coisas são  mais do que parecem. Hmm? Esqueça. DONKEY (suspira com um grande suspiro) Ei, Shrek, o que  que vamos fazer quando chegarmos ao nosso pântano de qualquer maneira? SHREK O nosso pântano? DONKEY Sabe, quando terminamos o salvamento  a princesa. SHREK Nós? Burro, não há ""nós"". Não há  sem ""nosso"". Só há eu e o meu pântano.  A primeira coisa que vou fazer é construir  um muro de dez pés à volta da minha terra. DONKEY Cortaste-me fundo, Shrek. Tu cortas-me a sério  profundo, agora mesmo. Sabem o que eu penso?  Penso que toda esta coisa da parede é apenas  uma forma de manter alguém de fora. SHREK Não, acha que não? DONKEY Está a esconder alguma coisa? SHREK Não importa, Burro. DONKEY Oh, esta é outra daquelas cebolas  coisas, não é? SHREK Não, esta é uma daquelas gota-it e  deixar as coisas em paz. DONKEY Porque não quer falar sobre isso? SHREK Porque quer falar sobre o assunto? DONKEY Porque é que está a bloquear? SHREK Não estou a bloquear. DONKEY Oh, sim, está. SHREK Burro, estou a avisá-lo. DONKEY Quem tenta manter de fora? SHREK Todos! Está bem? DONKEY (pausa) Oh, agora estamos a chegar a algum lado.  (sorrisos) Nesta altura, Fiona afasta a \'porta\' da entrada para  a caverna e os picos de saída. Nenhum dos rapazes a vêem. SHREK Oh! pelo amor de Pete! (levanta-se e  caminha até à beira do penhasco  e senta-se) DONKEY Qual é o seu problema? O que tem contra  o mundo inteiro de qualquer maneira? SHREK Olha, não sou eu que tenho o problema,  ok? É o mundo que parece ter  um problema para mim. As pessoas dão uma vista de olhos  a mim e vai. ""Aah! Socorro! Corre! Um grande,  ogre estúpido e feio""! Eles julgam-me antes  eles até me conhecem. É por isso que sou melhor  sozinho. DONKEY Sabe que mais? Quando nos conhecemos, eu não  pensar que era apenas um grande, estúpido, feio  ogre. SHREK Sim, eu sei. DONKEY Então, há burros lá em cima? SHREK Bem, há, hum, Gabby, a Pequena  e irritante.   DONKEY Está bem, está bem, já o vejo. O grande brilhante  um, ali mesmo. Aquele ali? Fiona coloca a porta de volta. SHREK Isso é a lua. DONKEY Está bem. DuLoc - Quarto do Farquaad A máquina fotográfica empurra sobre um monte de coisas do casamento. A música suave toca  no fundo. Farquaad está na cama, observando como a Magia  Mirror mostra-lhe a Princesa Fiona. FARQUAAD Mais uma vez, mostre-me outra vez. Espelho, espelho,  mostre-ma. Mostre-me a princesa. MIRROR Hmph. O Espelho rebobina e começa a tocar novamente desde o início. FARQUAAD Ah. Perfeito. Farquaad olha para baixo para o seu peito nu e puxa o lençol para cima  para se cobrir como se Fiona pudesse vê-lo como se ele olhasse com ovinho  à sua imagem no espelho. MANHÃ Fiona sai da caverna. Ela olha para Shrek e Burro  que ainda estão a dormir. Ela vagueia pela floresta e vem  através de um pássaro azul. Ela começa a cantar. O pássaro canta ao longo  com ela. Ela atinge notas cada vez mais altas e as lutas das aves  para a acompanhar. De repente, a pressão da nota é demasiado  grande e o pássaro explode. A Fiona parece um pouco corpulenta, mas  ela olha os ovos que a ave deixou para trás. O tempo passa, Fiona  está agora a cozinhar os ovos para o pequeno-almoço. O Shrek e o Burro ainda estão  a dormir. Shrek acorda e olha para a Fiona. O burro está a falar  durante o seu sono. DONKEY (em silêncio) Mmm, sim, você sabe que eu gosto  é assim. Vamos lá, querida. Eu disse  Eu gosto. SHREK Burro, acorda. (abana-o) DONKEY Huh? O quê? SHREK Acorda. DONKEY O quê? (alongamentos e bocejos) FIONA Bom dia. Hm, como gosta da sua  ovos? DONKEY Oh, bom dia, Princesa! Fiona levanta-se e põe os ovos na frente deles. SHREK De que se trata tudo isto? FIONA Sabe, nós meio que nos saímos mal  começar ontem. Eu queria fazê-lo  até si. Afinal de contas, fez  salvar-me. SHREK Obrigado. O burro fareja os ovos e lambe os seus lábios. FIONA Bem, coma. Temos um grande dia pela frente  de nós. (sai a pé) MAIS TARDE Estão mais uma vez a caminho. Estão a caminhar através do  floresta. Cinturões de sucata. DONKEY Shrek! SHREK O quê? É um elogio. É melhor sair  do que em, digo sempre. (risos) DONKEY Bem, não é maneira de se comportar na frente  de uma princesa. Fiona arrota FIONA Obrigado. DONKEY Ela é tão desagradável como você. SHREK (risos) Sabe, você não é exactamente  o que eu esperava. FIONA Bem, talvez não devesse julgar as pessoas  antes de os conhecer. Ela sorri e depois continua a andar, cantando suavemente. De repente  do nada, um homem balança para baixo e leva a Fiona para cima  uma árvore. ROBIN HOOD La liberte! Hey! SHREK Princesa! FIONA (a Robin Hood) O que estás a fazer? ROBIN HOOD Fica quieto, mon cherie, porque eu sou o teu salvador!  E eu estou a resgatar-te deste verde...(beijos  pelo braço acima enquanto Fiona puxa para dentro  repugnância)...besta. SHREK Ei! é a minha princesa! Vai à tua procura!  próprio! ROBIN HOOD Por favor, monstro! Não vêem que eu sou um  pouco ocupado aqui? FIONA (a ficar farto) Olha, amigo, eu não  saiba quem pensa que é! ROBIN HOOD Oh! claro! Oh, que falta de educação! Por favor  deixem-me apresentar-me. Homens alegres.  (risos) De repente, um acordeão começa a tocar e os homens alegres aparecem  dos arbustos. Eles começam a cantar a canção temática de Robin. HOMENS DE VERÃO Ta, dah, dah, dah, dah, whoo. ROBIN HOOD Eu roubo aos ricos e dou aos  necessitados. HOMENS DE VERÃO Toma uma pequena percentagem, ROBIN HOOD Mas eu não sou ganancioso. Resgatei bonita  donzelas, meu, estou bem. HOMENS DE VERÃO Que tipo, Monsieur Hood. ROBIN HOOD Derrubá-lo. Eu gosto de uma luta honesta  e uma empregada atrevida... HOMENS DE VERÃO O que ele está basicamente a dizer é que ele gosta  para obter... ROBIN HOOD Pago. Então....Quando um ogre no mato  agarra uma senhora pelo rabo. Isso é mau. HOMENS DE L\'HERMITAGE Isso é mau. ROBIN HOOD Quando uma beleza está com uma besta, faz  eu terrivelmente louco. HOMENS DE L\'HERMITAGE Ele é louco, ele é realmente, realmente louco. ROBIN HOOD Vou pegar na minha lâmina e enfiá-la  o vosso coração, mantenham os vossos olhos em mim, rapazes  porque estou prestes a começar... Há um grunhido enquanto a Fiona balança a partir do membro da árvore e  deixa Robin Hood inconsciente. FIONA Meu, isso foi irritante! Shrek olha para ela com admiração. HOMEM DE LARRY Oh, seu pequeno... - (dispara uma flecha a  Fiona mas ela pata fora do caminho) A seta voa em direcção ao burro que salta para os braços do Shrek para  saia do caminho. A flecha continua a saltar de uma árvore. Começa outra sequência de luta e Fiona dá um grito de karaté e  depois continua a dar uma tareia aos Merry Men. Há  um momento \'Matrix\' muito interessante aqui quando Fiona faz uma pausa em  a meio do ar para lhe arranjar o cabelo. Finalmente todos os Merry Men estão em baixo,  e Fiona começa a afastar-se.  FIONA Devemos nós? SHREK Segure o telefone. (larga o burro e começa  andar atrás de Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,  whoa. Espera aí. Onde é que isso aconteceu?  de? FIONA O quê? SHREK Isso! Aí atrás. Aquilo foi espantoso!  Onde aprendeste isso? FIONA Bem...(risos) quando se vive sozinho,  uh, há que aprender estas coisas em  caso há um...(gasps e pontos)  há uma seta no seu rabo! SHREK O quê? (vira e olha) Oh, queres  olhar para isso? (ele vai puxá-lo para fora  mas vacila porque é tenro) FIONA Oh, não. Isto é tudo culpa minha. Eu sou tão  desculpe. DONKEY (subir a pé) Porquê? O que é que está errado? FIONA O Shrek está ferido. DONKEY O Shrek está ferido. O Shrek está ferido? Oh, não,  O Shrek vai morrer. SHREK Burro, eu estou bem. DONKEY Não me podes fazer isto, Shrek. Eu sou  demasiado jovem para que morra. Manter as suas pernas  elevado. Virar a cabeça e tossir.  Alguém conhece o Heimlich? FIONA Burro! Acalme-se. Se quiseres ajudar  Shrek, corre para o bosque e encontra-me  uma flor azul com espinhos vermelhos. DONKEY Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos. Muito bem, estou em  ele. Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos. Não morrer  Shrek. Se vir um túnel longo, fique  longe da luz! SHREK & FIONA Burro! DONKEY Ah, sim. Certo. Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos.  (foge) SHREK Para que servem as flores? FIONA (como se fosse óbvio) Para se livrar  de burro. SHREK Ah. FIONA Agora fica quieto, e eu vou puxar isto  coisa para fora. (dá à seta um pouco de  puxar) SHREK (salta fora) Ow! Hey! fácil com o  yankin\'. Enquanto continuam a falar, Fiona continua a perseguir a seta e  Shrek continua a esquivar-se às suas mãos. FIONA Lamento, mas tem de ser divulgado. SHREK Não, é tenro. FIONA Agora, espere aí. SHREK O que se está a fazer é o oposto de  ajuda. FIONA Não se mexa. SHREK Vejam, o tempo acabou. FIONA Será que...(grunhidos como Shrek coloca o seu  entregar-lhe o rosto para a impedir de  chegar à seta) Está bem. O que fazer  propõe que o façamos? ELSEWHERE O burro ainda está à procura da flor especial. DONKEY Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos. Flor azul,  espinhos vermelhos. Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos.  Isto seria muito mais fácil se eu não estivesse  daltónico! Flor azul, espinhos vermelhos. SHREK (os) Ow! DONKEY Espera aí, Shrek! Estou a ir! (rasga um  florescer de um arbusto próximo que apenas acontece  ser uma flor azul com espinhos vermelhos) O CAMINHO FLORESTAL SHREK Ow! Não é bom. FIONA Está bem. Está bem. Quase consigo ver a cabeça.  (Shrek grunhe como ela puxa) É apenas  sobre... SHREK Ow! Ohh! (ele sacode e consegue cair  com Fiona em cima dele) DONKEY Ahem. SHREK (atirando Fiona de cima dele) Nada  aconteceu. Estávamos apenas, uh - - - DONKEY Olhem, se queriam estar sozinhos, todos  que tinha de fazer era pedir. Está bem? SHREK Oh, vá lá! Essa é a última coisa em  a minha mente. A princesa aqui era apenas...  - (Fiona puxa a seta para fora) Ugh! (ele  vira-se para olhar para Fiona que se aguenta  a seta com um sorriso) Ow! DONKEY O que é isso? (risinho nervoso)  Isso é....isso é sangue? O burro desmaia. Shrek caminha e apanha-o enquanto eles continuam  no seu caminho. Há uma montagem de cenas enquanto o grupo regressa à DuLoc.  O Shrek rasteja até ao topo de uma árvore para a fazer cair sobre um  pequeno riacho, para que a Fiona não se molhe. Shrek levanta-se então como  O burro está prestes a atravessar a árvore e a árvore balança de volta  na sua posição vertical e o burro voa para fora. Shrek a bater  e um bando de moscas e mosquitos. Fiona agarra uma teia de aranha próxima  que está num ramo de árvore e corre através do campo a balançá-lo  para apanhar os insectos. Depois entrega-o ao Shrek que começa  a comer como se fosse um deleite. À medida que ele se afasta, ela lambe os dedos.  Shrek apanha um sapo e explode-o como se fosse um balão e apresenta  à Fiona. Fiona apanhar uma cobra, explodi-la, moldá-la  num animal balão e apresentando-o ao Shrek. O grupo  chegando a um moinho de vento que fica perto de DuLoc. WINDMILL SHREK Aí está, Princesa. O seu futuro espera-nos  você. FIONA Isso é DuLoc? DONKEY Sim, eu sei. Sabes, Shrek pensa  Lorde Farquaad está a compensar algo,  o que eu penso que significa que ele tem um verdadeiro...(Shrek  pisa no seu casco) Ow!  SHREK Um, eu, uh- - acho que é melhor mudarmo-nos  em. FIONA Claro. Mas, Shrek? Estou - - - Estou preocupada  sobre Burro. SHREK O quê? FIONA Olhem só para ele. Ele não olha  tão bom. DONKEY Do que está a falar? Estou bem. FIONA (ajoelha-se para olhá-lo nos olhos) Isso é  o que dizem sempre, e a seguir  coisa que você sabe, você está de costas.  (pausa) Morto. SHREK Ela tem razão. Está com péssimo aspecto.  Queres sentar-te? FIONA Vou fazer-lhe um chá. DONKEY Eu não queria dizer nada, mas eu  tenho esta pontada no pescoço, e quando  Viro a minha cabeça assim, olha, (vira  o seu pescoço de uma forma muito afiada até ao seu  cabeça está completamente de lado) Ow! Vês? SHREK Quem está com fome? Vou arranjar-nos um jantar. FIONA Vou buscar a lenha. DONKEY Onde vais? Oh, meu, eu não posso  Sinta os meus dedos dos pés! (olha para baixo e grita)  Eu não tenho dedos dos pés! Acho que preciso de  um abraço. SUNSET Shrek construiu uma fogueira e está a cozinhar o resto do jantar enquanto  A Fiona come. FIONA Mmm. Isto é bom. Isto é realmente bom.  O que é isto? SHREK Rato erva daninha. Estilo rotisserie. FIONA Não brinca. Bem, isto é delicioso. SHREK Bem, também são óptimos em guisados. Agora,  Não me quero gabar, mas faço um mau  guisado de rato de erva daninha. (risadinhas) Fiona olha para a DuLoc e suspira. FIONA Acho que vou jantar um pouco diferente  amanhã à noite. SHREK Talvez possa vir visitar-me no pântano  um dia destes. Vou cozinhar todo o tipo de coisas  para si. Sopa de sapo do pântano, tarte de olho de peixe  - o seu nome. FIONA (sorrisos) Eu gostaria disso. Eles sorriem um para o outro. SHREK Um, Princesa? FIONA Sim, Shrek? SHREK Eu, hum, eu estava a pensar...(suspiros)  Vai comer isso? DONKEY (risos) Meu, isto não é romântico?  Basta olhar para aquele pôr-do-sol. FIONA (salta para cima) Pôr-do-sol? Oh, não! Quer dizer, é  tarde. I-É muito tarde. SHREK O quê? DONKEY Espere um minuto. Estou a ver o que se está a passar  aqui. Tens medo do escuro, não tens  você? FIONA Sim! Sim, é isso mesmo. Estou aterrorizado.  É melhor eu ir para dentro. DONKEY Não se sinta mal, Princesa. Eu costumava  ter medo do escuro, também, até -  - Ei, não, espera. Eu ainda tenho medo de  a escuridão. Suspiros de Shrek FIONA Boa noite. SHREK Boa noite. Fiona entra no moinho de vento e fecha a porta. Olhar de burro  em Shrek com um novo olho. DONKEY Ohh! agora vejo realmente o que se está a passar  aqui. SHREK De que estás a falar? DONKEY Nem sequer o quero ouvir. Olha, eu sou  um animal, e eu tenho instintos. E  Eu sei que vocês os dois estavam a cavar em cada  outros. Pude senti-lo. SHREK És louco. Estou apenas a trazê-la  de volta a Farquaad. DONKEY Oh, vá lá, Shrek. Acorda e cheira  as feromonas. Basta entrar e dizer  ela como se sente. SHREK I- - Não há nada a dizer. Além disso, não há nada a dizer,  mesmo que eu lhe dissesse que, bem, você  sei - - e não estou a dizer que sei porque  Eu não - - - ela é uma princesa, e eu sou  - - DONKEY Um ogre? SHREK Sim. Um ogre. DONKEY Onde vais? SHREK Para conseguir... mover lenha. (suspiros) O burro já olha para a grande pilha de lenha que lá se encontra  é. TEMPO LAPSE O burro abre a porta do moinho de vento e entra. Fiona é  em lado nenhum para ser visto. DONKEY Princesa? Princesa Fiona? Princesa,  onde está? Princesa? Fiona olha para Burro das sombras, mas não a conseguimos ver. DONKEY Aqui dentro é muito assustador. Eu não estou a brincar  sem jogos. De repente, Fiona cai do corrimão. Ela levanta-se só que não  parecer-se com ela própria. Ela parece um ogre e o burro começa a passar-se.  fora. DONKEY Aah! FIONA Oh, não! DONKEY Não, socorro! FIONA Shh! DONKEY Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! FIONA Não, está tudo bem. Está tudo bem. DONKEY O que fez com a princesa? FIONA Burro, eu sou a princesa. DONKEY Aah! FIONA Sou eu, neste corpo. DONKEY Oh, meu Deus! Comeste a princesa. (a  o seu estômago) Consegues ouvir-me? FIONA Burro! DONKEY (ainda dirigida ao seu estômago) Ouçam,  continuar a respirar! Vou tirá-lo de  lá! FIONA Não! DONKEY Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! FIONA Shh. DONKEY Shrek! FIONA Este sou eu. O burro olha-a nos olhos enquanto ela lhe faz o focinho, e ele acalma  para baixo. DONKEY Princesa? O que lhe aconteceu? Foi você,  uh, uh, uh, diferente. FIONA Eu sou feio, está bem? DONKEY Bem, sim! Foi algo que comeu?  Porque eu disse ao Shrek que aqueles ratos eram um  má ideia. Você é o que come, disse eu.  Agora - - FIONA Não. I - - Estou assim há tanto tempo  como me consigo lembrar. DONKEY O que quer dizer? Olhe, eu nunca  já o vi assim antes. FIONA Só acontece quando o sol se põe.  ""De noite de uma maneira, de dia de outra"". Isto  será a norma... até encontrar  o primeiro beijo de amor verdadeiro... e depois tomar  a verdadeira forma do amor"". DONKEY Ah, isso é lindo. Eu não sabia  escreveu poesia. FIONA É um feitiço. (suspiro) Quando eu era um pouco  rapariga, uma bruxa lançou um feitiço sobre mim. Cada  noite, torno-me nisto. Esta noite horrível,  besta horrível! Fui colocado numa torre  para esperar o dia em que o meu verdadeiro amor  salvar-me. É por isso que tenho de me casar  Lorde Farquaad amanhã antes do sol  e ele vê-me assim. (começa  a chorar)  DONKEY Muito bem, muito bem. Acalme-se. Veja,  não é assim tão mau. Não é assim tão feio.  Bem, não vou mentir. Tu és feio.  Mas só tens este aspecto à noite.  O Shrek é feio 24-7. FIONA Mas Burro, eu sou uma princesa, e isto  não é como deve ser uma princesa. DONKEY Princesa, que tal se não se casar  Farquaad? FIONA Tenho de o fazer. Apenas o meu verdadeiro beijo de amor  pode quebrar o feitiço. DONKEY Mas, você sabe, hum, você é uma espécie de  orge, e Shrek - - bem, você tem um  muito em comum. FIONA Shrek? FORA Shrek caminha em direcção ao moinho de vento com um girassol no seu  mão. SHREK (para si próprio) Princesa, I - - Uh, como é  vai, antes de mais nada? Bom? Hum, bom  para mim também. Eu estou bem. Eu vi esta flor  e pensou em si porque é bonito  e - - bem, eu não gosto muito,  mas pensei que poderia gostar porque  é bonita. Mas gosto de si na mesma.  Eu - - uh, uh...(suspiros) estou em apuros.  Pronto, aqui vamos nós. Ele vai até à porta e faz uma pausa lá fora quando ouve Burro  e Fiona a falar. FIONA (os) Não posso simplesmente casar com quem eu quiser.  Olha bem para mim, Burro. Quer dizer,  realmente, quem pode amar uma besta assim  hediondo e feio? ""Princesa"" e ""feia""  não andem juntos. É por isso que eu não posso  ficar aqui com Shrek. Shrek recua em estado de choque. FIONA (os) A minha única hipótese de viver feliz  para sempre é casar com o meu verdadeiro amor. O Shrek suspira fundo. Atira a flor ao chão e caminha  longe. INSIDE FIONA Não vês, Burro? É assim mesmo  tem de ser. É a única forma de quebrar  o feitiço. DONKEY Pelo menos tem de dizer a verdade a Shrek. FIONA Não! Não se consegue respirar uma palavra. Ninguém  deve sempre saber. DONKEY Qual é o interesse de poder falar  se tem de guardar segredos? FIONA Prometa que não vai contar. Prometa! DONKEY Muito bem, muito bem. Não lhe vou dizer.  Mas devia. (vai lá para fora) Eu só  saber antes que isto acabe, eu vou  precisam de uma terapia muito séria.  Olhem para o meu olhar a contorcer-se. A Fiona sai pela porta e observa-o a afastar-se. Ela olha  para baixo e mancha o girassol. Ela apanha-o antes de voltar  dentro do moinho de vento. MANHÃ O burro está a dormir. O Shrek não se encontra em lado nenhum. A Fiona ainda está  acordados. Ela está a arrancar pétalas do girassol. FIONA Eu digo-lhe, eu digo-lhe que não. Digo-lhe eu,  Eu digo-lhe que não. Digo-lhe eu. (ela rapidamente  corre para a porta e vai lá para fora) Shrek!  Shrek, há algo que eu quero...(ela  olha e vê o sol nascente, e como  o sol faz o céu girar para trás  num humano). Assim que olha para o sol, vê Shrek a pisar para  ela. FIONA Shrek. Sente-se bem? SHREK Perfeito! Nunca esteve melhor. FIONA I - - Não tenho - - - Há algo  Tenho de vos dizer. SHREK Não tem de me dizer nada,  Princesa. Já ouvi o suficiente ontem à noite. FIONA Ouviu o que eu disse? SHREK Cada palavra. FIONA Pensei que compreenderia. SHREK Ah, compreendo. Como disseste, ""Quem  poderia amar uma besta horrenda e feia""? FIONA Mas eu pensei que isso não importaria para  você.  SHREK Sim? Pois bem, é verdade. (Fiona olha para  ele em estado de choque. Ele olha para além dela e  mancha um grupo que se aproxima). Ah, certo  a tempo. Princesa, eu trouxe-te  um pouco de alguma coisa. Farquaad chegou com um grupo dos seus homens. Ele parece muito régio  sentado em cima do seu cavalo. Nunca adivinharia que ele é apenas  com cerca de 3 pés de altura. O burro acorda com um bocejo enquanto os soldados  marchar por. DONKEY O que me escapou? O que é que eu perdi? (manchas  os soldados) (abafados) Quem disse isso?  Não pode ter sido o burro. FARQUAAD Princesa Fiona. SHREK Como prometido. Agora entregue-a. FARQUAAD Muito bem, ogre. (estende uma peça  de papel) A escritura para o seu pântano, limpo  para fora, como acordado. Pegar nele e ir antes de  Mudo de ideias. (Shrek leva o jornal)  Perdoa-me, Princesa, por me teres surpreendido  você, mas você assustou-me, pois eu tenho  nunca tinha visto uma beleza tão radiante.  Sou o Lorde Farquaad. FIONA Lorde Farquaad? Oh, não, não. (Farquaad  estala-lhe os dedos) Perdoai-me, meu senhor,  pois eu estava apenas a dizer um curto... (Relógios  enquanto Farquaad é levantado do seu cavalo  e pousou à sua frente. Ele vem  à sua cintura.) adeus. FARQUAAD Oh, isso é tão querido. Não tem  para desperdiçar boas maneiras com o ogre. É  não é como se tivesse sentimentos. FIONA Não, tem razão. Não tem. O burro assiste a esta troca com um olhar curioso na cara. FARQUAAD Princesa Fiona, bela, justa, impecável  Fiona. Peço a sua mão em casamento.  Serás a noiva perfeita para a  noivo perfeito? FIONA Senhor Farquaad, eu aceito. Nada  marca - - - FARQUAAD (interrompendo) Excelente! Vou começar  os planos, pois amanhã casamo-nos! FIONA Não! Quero dizer, porquê esperar? Vamos lá  casado hoje antes do pôr-do-sol. FARQUAAD Oh, ansioso, estás? Tem razão.  Quanto mais cedo, melhor. Há tanto  a fazer! Ali está o fornecedor, o bolo,  a banda, a lista de convidados. Capitão, redondo  alguns convidados! (um guarda coloca Fiona  no dorso do seu cavalo) FIONA Bem-aventurado, ogre. Toda a festa de Farquaad começa a regressar a DuLoc. Relógios de burro  eles vão. DONKEY Shrek, o que estás a fazer? Estás a deixar  a sua fuga. SHREK Sim? E depois? DONKEY Shrek, há algo nela que tu  não sei. Olha, eu falei com ela por último  noite, Ela é - - - SHREK Eu sei que falou com ela ontem à noite.  Vocês são grandes amigos, não são? Agora, se  vocês dois são tão bons amigos, porque não  segue a sua casa? DONKEY Shrek, I - - Quero ir contigo. SHREK Eu disse-lhe, não disse? Não vens  em casa comigo. Eu vivo sozinho! O meu pântano!  Eu! Mais ninguém! Percebem? Mais ninguém!  Especialmente inútil, patético, irritante,  burros falantes! DONKEY Mas eu pensei - - SHREK Sim. Sabe que mais? Pensou mal!  (pisa fora) DONKEY Shrek. Montagem de diferentes cenas. Shrek a regressar a casa. Fiona  ser ajustado para o vestido de noiva. Burro a correr num ribeiro  para o dragão. Shrek a limpar a sua casa. Fiona a comer o jantar  sozinho. Shrek a jantar sozinho. CASA DO SHREK Shrek está a jantar quando ouve um som lá fora. Ele vai  fora para investigar. SHREK Burro? (O burro ignora-o e continua  com o que ele está a fazer). O que é que você  a fazer? DONKEY Eu pensaria, de todas as pessoas, que você  reconhecer uma parede quando se vê uma. SHREK Bem, sim. Mas o muro é suposto  para dar a volta ao meu pântano, não através dele. DONKEY É cerca da sua metade. Veja que é a sua  metade, e esta é a minha metade. SHREK Oh! a sua metade. Hmm. DONKEY Sim, a minha metade. Eu ajudei a salvar a princesa.  Fiz metade do trabalho. Recebo metade da  espólio. Agora passa-me essa grande pedra velha,  a que se parece com a sua cabeça. SHREK Para trás! DONKEY Não, recuas. SHREK Este é o meu pântano! DONKEY O nosso pântano. SHREK (agarra o ramo de árvore O burro está a trabalhar  com) Larga-me, Burro! DONKEY Solta-se. SHREK Idiota teimoso! DONKEY Ogre fedorento. SHREK Muito bem! (deixa cair o ramo de árvore e anda  longe) DONKEY Ei, ei, voltem aqui. Ainda não acabei  consigo ainda. SHREK Bem, estou farto de si.  DONKEY Uh-uh. Contigo está sempre,  ""Eu, eu, eu!"" Bem, adivinhem só! Agora  é a minha vez! Então cala-te e  preste atenção! És mau para mim. Vós  insulta-me e não aprecia nada  que eu faço! Estás sempre a pressionar-me  ou empurrando-me para longe. SHREK Ah, sim? Bem, se eu te tratei assim  mau, como é que voltaste? DONKEY Porque é isso que os amigos fazem! Eles  perdoem-se uns aos outros! SHREK Ah, sim. Tens razão, Burro. Eu perdoo  você... por me apunhalar pelas costas!  (entra na casa e bate o  porta) DONKEY Ohh! estás tão envolto em camadas,  rapaz cebola, você tem medo do seu próprio  sentimentos. SHREK (os) Vá embora! DONKEY Aí está você , fazendo-o novamente apenas  como fez com a Fiona. Tudo o que ela sempre  fazer era como tu, talvez até te ame. SHREK (os) Ama-me? Ela disse que eu era feio, um  criatura hedionda. Ouvi os dois de  você a falar. DONKEY Ela não estava a falar de si. Ela estava  a falar de, uh, outra pessoa. SHREK (abre a porta e sai) Ela não estava  a falar de mim? Bem, então quem era  de que ela está a falar? DONKEY Nem pensar. Não vou dizer nada.  Não me queres ouvir. Não queres?  Não é verdade? SHREK Burro! DONKEY Não! SHREK Muito bem, vejam. Desculpa, está bem? (suspirar)  Lamento. Acho que sou apenas um grande,  ogre estúpido e feio. Pode perdoar-me? DONKEY É para isso que servem os amigos, certo? SHREK Certo. Amigos? DONKEY Amigos. SHREK Então, o que é que a Fiona disse sobre mim? DONKEY O que é que me estás a pedir? Porque é que não  vai simplesmente perguntar-lhe? SHREK O casamento! Nunca o conseguiremos em  tempo. DONKEY Ha-ha-ha! Nunca temam, pois onde, há  uma vontade, há uma maneira e eu tenho uma maneira.  (apitos) De repente, o dragão chega por cima e voa suficientemente baixo  eles podem subir. SHREK Burro? DONKEY Acho que é apenas o meu magnetismo animal. Ambos riem. SHREK Aw, vem cá, tu. (dá ao burro um  noogie) DONKEY Muito bem, muito bem. Não fique com tudo  baba. Ninguém gosta de beijar rabos. Todos  à direita, saltar e agarrar-se bem. Eu não tenho  teve a oportunidade de instalar os cintos de segurança  ainda. Subem a bordo do dragão e ela parte para a DuLoc. DULOC - IGREJA Fiona e Farquaad vão-se casar. A cidade inteira está lá.  O tipo do cartão de prontidão segura um cartão que diz ""Silêncio Reverenciado"". PRIEST Povo de DuLoc, reunimo-nos aqui hoje  para testemunhar a união.... FIONA (de olho no pôr-do-sol) Um- PRIEST do nosso novo rei... FIONA Com licença. Poderíamos simplesmente saltar à frente  para os ""eu faço""? FARQUAAD (risos e depois moções ao padre  para satisfazer a Fiona) Continua.  COURTYARD Alguns guardas estão a moer à volta. De repente, o dragão aterra com  um boom. Os guardas descolam todos a correr. DONKEY (ao Dragão) Vá em frente, Tenham alguma diversão.  Se precisarmos de si, assobiarei. Que tal  que? (ela acena com a cabeça e vai atrás dos guardas)  Shrek, espera, espera! Esperem um minuto! Tu  queres fazer isto bem, não queres? SHREK (à porta da Igreja) De que estás a falar?  sobre? DONKEY Há uma fila pela qual tem de esperar. A  O pregador vai dizer: ""Fala agora ou  cala-te para sempre"". É nessa altura que  dizes: ""Protesto!"" SHREK Não tenho tempo para isto! DONKEY Ei, esperem. O que estás a fazer? Ouve  para mim! Olha, tu amas esta mulher, não  você? SHREK Sim. DONKEY Queres segurá-la? SHREK Sim. DONKEY Agrada-lhe? SHREK Sim! DONKEY (cantando ao estilo de James Brown) Depois você  tem de, tem de experimentar um pouco de ternura.  (normal) Os filhotes adoram aquele romântico  bosta! SHREK Muito bem! Parem com isso. Quando é que isto acontece?  diz o tipo da linha? DONKEY Temos de o verificar. IGREJA INTERIOR Enquanto o padre fala, vemos a sombra do burro através de um dos  As janelas Shrek atira-o para cima para que ele possa ver. PRIEST E assim, pelo poder investido em mim... Fora SHREK O que vê? DONKEY A cidade inteira está lá dentro. Dentro de PRIEST Declaro-vos marido e mulher... Fora DONKEY Eles estão no altar. No interior PRIEST ...rei e rainha. Fora DONKEY Mãe Fletcher! Ele já o disse. SHREK Oh, pelo amor de Pete! Ele corre para dentro sem apanhar o Burro, que bate no chão com força. IGREJA INTERIOR SHREK (correndo em direcção ao altar) Eu oponho-me! FIONA Shrek? Toda a congregação gaseia como vê o Shrek. FARQUAAD Oh, agora o que é que ele quer? SHREK (à congregação à medida que chega à frente  da Igreja) Olá a todos. Tendo  um bom momento, não é? Eu amo DuLoc, primeiro  de todos. Muito limpo.  FIONA O que está a fazer aqui? SHREK Realmente, é suficientemente rude estar vivo  quando ninguém o quer, mas aparecer  sem ser convidado para um casamento. SHREK Fiona! Preciso de falar contigo. FIONA Oh, agora quer falar? É um pouco  tarde para isso, por isso, se me dão licença  - - SHREK Mas não se pode casar com ele. FIONA E porque não? SHREK Porque... - Porque ele está apenas a casar  para que ele possa ser rei. FARQUAAD Escandaloso! Fiona, não lhe dês ouvidos. SHREK Ele não é o seu verdadeiro amor. FIONA E o que sabe sobre o amor verdadeiro? SHREK Bem, eu - - - Uh - - - quero dizer - - - FARQUAAD Oh, isto é precioso. O ogee caiu  apaixonado pela princesa! Oh, que bom!  Senhor. (risos) O tipo do cartão de ponto segura um cartão que diz \'Risos\'. O  risos de toda a congregação. FARQUAAD Um ogre e uma princesa! FIONA Shrek, será isto verdade? FARQUAAD Quem se importa? É um absurdo! Fiona,  meu amor, estamos apenas a um beijo de  o nosso ""felizes para sempre"". Agora beija-me!  (enfia os seus lábios e inclina-se para ela,  mas ela recua). FIONA (olhando para o pôr-do-sol) ""À noite  de uma maneira, de dia para dia outra"". (para Shrek)  Queria mostrar-vos antes. Ela recua e, quando o sol se põe, transforma-se no seu eu ogre.  Ela dá a Shrek um sorriso de ovelha. SHREK Bem, uh, isso explica muita coisa. (Fiona  sorrisos) FARQUAAD Ugh! É nojento! Guardas! Guardas!  Ordeno-vos que me tirem isso da vista!  agora! Apanhem-nos! Apanhem-nos aos dois! Os guardas entram e separam Fiona e Shrek. As lutas do Shrek  eles. SHREK Não, não! FIONA Shrek! FARQUAAD Este hocus-pocus não altera nada. Isto  o casamento é vinculativo, e isso faz  eu rei! Vêem? Vêem? FIONA Não, larguem-me! Shrek! SHREK Não! FARQUAAD Não fiquem aí parados, seus idiotas. SHREK Saiam do meu caminho! Fiona! Arrgh! FARQUAAD Faço-o lamentar o dia em que nos conhecemos.  Ver-te-ei desenhado e esquartejado! Vai  implorar pela morte para o salvar! FIONA Não, Shrek! FARQUAAD (segure uma adaga na garganta da Fiona) E  quanto a si, minha esposa... SHREK Fiona! FARQUAAD Vou tê-lo de volta fechado naquela torre  para o resto dos seus dias! Eu sou rei!  O Shrek consegue libertar uma mão e assobia. FARQUAAD Terei ordem! Terei a perfeição!  Terei - - (Burro e o dragão  aparecer e o dragão inclina-se para baixo e  come Farquaad) Aaaaah! Aaaaah! DONKEY Muito bem. Ninguém se mexe. Eu tenho um dragão  aqui, e não tenho medo de o utilizar.  (O dragão ruge.) Eu sou um burro em  a borda! O dragão arrota e a coroa do Farquaad voa da sua boca  e cai ao chão. DONKEY Casamentos de celebridades. Eles nunca duram,  será que o fazem? A congregação aplaude. DONKEY Vá em frente, Shrek. SHREK Uh, Fiona? FIONA Sim, Shrek? SHREK I - - Eu amo-te. FIONA A sério? SHREK Realmente, realmente. FIONA (sorrisos) Eu também te amo. Shrek e Fiona beijam-se. Thelonius pega numa das cartas e escreve  \'Awwwww\' no verso e depois mostra-o à congregação. CONGREGAÇÃO Aawwww! De repente, a magia do feitiço afasta a Fiona. Ela é levantada  para o ar e ela paira lá enquanto a magia funciona  ela. WHISPERS ""Até encontrar o primeiro beijo de amor verdadeiro  e depois tomar a verdadeira forma do amor. Tomar  a verdadeira forma do amor. Assumir a verdadeira forma do amor"". De repente, os olhos de Fiona abrem-se de par em par. Ela é consumida pelo feitiço  e depois é lentamente abaixada até ao chão. SHREK (indo ter com ela) Fiona? Fiona. São  estás bem? FIONA (de pé, ela ainda é um ogre) Bem,  sim. Mas eu não compreendo. Eu deveria  para ser bela. SHREK Mas VOCÊ ESTÁ LINDO. Sorriem um para o outro. DONKEY (risos) Eu esperava que isto fosse  um final feliz. Shrek e Fiona beijam...e o beijo desvanece-se em... O PANTANO ...o seu beijo de casamento. Shrek e Fiona são agora casados. ""Eu sou  a Believer\' por Smashmouth é jogado em segundo plano. Shrek  e a Fiona separam-se e correm através da multidão à sua espera  carruagem. Que é feita de uma cebola gigante. Fiona atira o seu ramo de flores  que tanto a Cinderela como a Branca de Neve tentam apanhar. Mas elas acabam  de se meter numa luta de gatos e assim o dragão apanha o ramo de flores  em vez disso. O homem dos Pão de Gengibre foi de certa forma remendado e agora  tem uma perna e caminha com uma bengala doce. Shrek e Fiona  sair enquanto o resto dos convidados se diverte e Burro toma conta  a cantar a canção. HOMEM DE PÃO DE GENGIBRE Deus nos abençoe, a todos.  DONKEY (como ele já cantou e nós desvanecemo-nos para  preto) Oh, isso é engraçado. Oh. Oh. Eu não posso  respirar. Não consigo respirar. O FIM",,2

The difficulty is commonly caused by that the users’ intention for searching image is different with dominant information of the image collected from feature extraction. In this paper we present a new approach for content-dependent image search system. The system utilizes information of color distribution inside an image and detects a cloud of clustered colors as something - supposed as an object. We applies segmentation of image as content-dependent process before feature extraction in order to identify is there any object or not inside an image. The system extracts 3 features, which are color, shape, and texture features and aggregates these features for similarity measurement between an image query and image database. HSV histogram color is used to extract color feature of image. While the shape feature extraction used Connected Component Labeling (CCL) which is calculated the area value, equivalent diameter, extent, convex hull, solidity, eccentricity, and perimeter of each object. The texture feature extraction used Leung Malik (LM)’s approach with 15 kernels.

Tune in to the Labs    We take the outcomes announced by free antivirus testing labs in all respects truly. The basic reality that a specific merchant's item appears in the outcomes is a demonstration of positive support, of sorts. It implies the lab considered the item huge, and the merchant felt the expense of testing was advantageous. Obviously, getting great scores in the tests is additionally significant.    We pursue four labs that normally discharge nitty gritty reports: SE Labs, AV-Test Institute, MRG-Effitas, and AV-Comparatives. We likewise note whether sellers have contracted with ICSA Labs and West Coast labs for affirmation.    We Test Malware, Spyware, and Adware Defenses We additionally subject each item to our very own hands-on trial of malware assurance, to a limited extent to get an inclination for how the item functions. Contingent upon how altogether the item averts malware establishment, it can acquire up to 10 for malware assurance.    Our malware assurance test fundamentally utilizes a similar arrangement of tests for quite a long time. To check an item's treatment of fresh out of the box new malware, we test every item utilizing 100 amazingly new malware-facilitating URLs provided by MRG-Effitas, taking note of what level of them it blocked. Items get equivalent kudos for anticipating all entrance to the vindictive URL and for clearing out the malware during download.    A few items win completely outstanding evaluations from the autonomous labs, yet don't toll too in our grasp on tests. In such cases, we concede to the labs, as they carry altogether more prominent assets to their testing. Need to know more? You can dive in for a point by point portrayal of how we test security programming.    Multilayered Malware Protection    Antivirus items separate themselves by going past the fundamentals of on-request examining and ongoing malware insurance. Some rate URLs that you visit or that appear in indexed lists, utilizing a red-yellow-green shading coding framework. Some effectively square procedures on your framework from associating with known malware-facilitating URLs or with false (phishing) pages.    Programming has imperfections, and here and there those blemishes influence your mcafee security. Judicious clients keep Windows and all projects fixed, fixing those imperfections at the earliest opportunity.

Any antivirus should deal with spyware, alongside every other sort of malware, yet some incorporate specific segments gave to spyware insurance.    You expect an antivirus to recognize and dispose of terrible projects, and to disregard great projects. Shouldn't something be said about questions, programs it can't distinguish as positive or negative? Conduct based discovery can, in principle, secure you against malware that is so new scientists have never experienced it. In any case, this isn't generally an unmixed gift. It's normal for social discovery frameworks to hail numerous harmless practices performed by genuine projects.    Whitelisting is another way to deal with the issue of obscure projects. A whitelist-based security framework just permits realized great projects to run. Questions are prohibited. This mode sometimes falls short for all circumstances, however it very well may be helpful. Sandboxing gives obscure projects a chance to run, however it segregates them from full access to your framework, so they can't do lasting damage. These different added layers serve to upgrade your assurance against malware.    What's the Best Malware Protection?    mcafee.com/activate antivirus would it be advisable for you to pick?
