Understanding human mobility has gain importance to offer better services able to provide valuable products to the user whenever it's required. The ability to predict when and where individuals will go next allows enabling smart recommendation systems or a better organization of resources such as public transport vehicles or taxis. Network providers can predict future activities of individuals and groups to optimize network handovers, while transport systems can provide more vehicles or lines where required, reducing waiting time and discomfort to their clients.   The representation of the movements of individuals or groups of mobile entities are called human mobility models. Such models replicate real human mobility characteristics, enabling to simulate movements of different individuals and infer their future whereabouts.  The development of these models requires to collect in a centralized location, as a server, the information related to the users' locations.  Such data represents sensitive information, and the collection of those threatens the privacy of the users involved. The recent introduction of federated learning, a privacy-preserving approach to build machine and deep learning models, represents a promising technique to solve the privacy issue. Federated learning allows mobile devices to contribute with their private data to the model creation without sharing them with a centralized server. In this thesis, we investigate the application of the federated learning paradigm to the field of human mobility modelling.  Using three different mobility datasets, we first designed and developed a robust human mobility model by investigating different classes of neural networks and the influence of demographic data over models' performance. Second, we applied federated learning to create a human mobility model based on deep learning which does not require the collection of users' mobility traces, achieving promising results on two different datasets. Users' data remains so distributed over the big number of devices which have generated them, while the model is shared and trained among the server and the devices.  Furthermore, the developed federated model has been the subject of different analyses including: the effects of sparse availability of the clients; The communication costs required by federated settings; The application of transfer-learning techniques and model refinement through federated learning and, lastly, the influence of differential privacy on the model’s prediction performance, also called utility""}","federated-learning,human-mobility,tensorflow-federated-learning",8

These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, company needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.

The MIT Media Lab for Computational Physiology has developed MIMIC-IIIv1.4 dataset based on 46,520 patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of Boston between 2001 and 2012. MIMIC-IIIv1.4 dataset is freely available to researchers across the world. A formal request should be made directly to www.mimic.physionet.org, to gain access to the data. There is a required course on human research ‘Data or Specimens Only Research’ prior to data access request. I have secured one here -www.citiprogram.org/verify/?kb6607b78-5821-4de5-8cad-daf929f7fbbf-33486907.  We built flexible and better performing model using the same 17 variables used in the SAPS II severity prediction model. The question ‘Can we improve the prediction performance of widely used severity scores using a more flexible model?’ is the central question of our project.  I used the exact 17 variables used to develop the SAPS II severity prediction algorithm. These are 13 physiological variables, three underlying (chronic) disease variables and one admission variable.  The physiological variables includes demographic (age), vital (Glasgow Comma Scale, systolic blood pressure, Oxygenation, Renal, White blood cells count, serum bicarbonate level, blood sodium level, blood potassium level, and blood bilirubin level). The three underlying disease variables includes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy. Finally, whether admission was scheduled surgical or unscheduled surgical was included in the model.  The dataset has 26 relational tables including patient’s hospital admission, callout information when patient was ready for discharge, caregiver information, electronic charted events including vital signs and any additional information relevant to patient care, patient demographic data, list of services the patient was admitted or transferred under, ICU stay types, diagnoses types, laboratory measurments, microbiology tests and sensitivity, prescription data and billing information.  Although I have full access to the MIMIC-IIIv1.4 datasets, I can not share any part of the data publicly.

The objectives of these measurements are to diagnose the level of Dementia in the individuals and the probability that these individuals may have Alzheimer\'s Disease (AD).  In published studies, Machine Learning has been applied to Alzheimer’s/Dementia identification from MRI scans and related data in the academic papers/theses in References 10 and 11 listed in the References Section below. Recently, a close relative of mine had to undergo a sequence of MRI tests for cognition difficulties.The motivation for choosing this topic for the Capstone project arose from the desire to understand and analyze potential for Dementia and AD from MRI related data. Cognitive testing, clinical assessments and demographic data related to these MRI tests are used in this project. This Capstone project does not use the MRI ""imaging"" data and does not focus on AD, focusses only on Dementia.  *****Conclusions, Justification, and Reflections*****  [Student adequately summarizes the end-to-end problem solution and discusses one or two particular aspects of the project they found interesting or difficult.]  The formulation of OASIS data (Ref 1 and 2) in terms of a dementia classification problem based on demographic and clinical data only (and without directly using the MRI image data), is a simplification that has major advantages and appeal. This means the trained model can classify whether an individual has dementia or not with about 87% accuracy, without having to wait for radiological interpretation of MRI scans. This can provide an early alert for intervention and initiation of treatment for those with onset of dementia.  The assumption that the combined cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets would lead to dementia label classification of acceptable accuracy came out to be true. The method required careful data cleaning and data preparation work, converting it to a binary classification problem, as outlined in this notebook.  At the outset it was not clear which algorithm(s) would be more appropriate for the binary and multi-label classification problem. The approach of spot checking the algorithms early for accuracy led to the determination of a smaller set of algorithms with higher accuracy (e.g. Gadient Boosting and Random Forest) for a deeper dive examination, e.g. use of a k-fold cross-validation approach in classifying the CDR label.  The neural network benchmark model accuracy of 78% for binary classification was exceeded by the classification accuracy of the main output of this study, the trained Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classification models. This builds confidence in the latter model for further training with new data and further classification use for new patients.",,6

132,https://github.com/sachink382/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis---Analytics-Vidhya.git,"{""Problem Statement The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.  Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.     Motivation Hate  speech  is  an  unfortunately  common  occurrence  on  the  Internet.  Often social media sites like Facebook and Twitter face the problem of identifying and censoring  problematic  posts  while weighing the right to freedom of speech. The  importance  of  detecting  and  moderating hate  speech  is  evident  from  the  strong  connection between hate speech and actual hate crimes. Early identification of users promoting  hate  speech  could  enable  outreach  programs that attempt to prevent an escalation from speech to action. Sites such as Twitter and Facebook have been seeking  to  actively  combat  hate  speech. In spite of these reasons, NLP research on hate speech has been very limited, primarily due to the lack of a general definition of hate speech, an analysis of its demographic influences, and an investigation of the most effective features.     Data Our overall collection of tweets was split in the ratio of 65:35 into training and testing data. Out of the testing data, 30% is public and the rest is private.     Data Files    train.csv - For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet. There is 1 test file (public)  test_tweets.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.  ""}",,5

Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features          DEPLOY the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurants ratings  A step by step guide is attached to this documnet as well as a video explanation of each concpet.  Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.   We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this analysis.  Content The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.  With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India.

With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as      • Location of the restaurant     • Approx Price of food     • Theme based restaurant or not     • Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants     • The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood     • Is a particular neighborhood famous for its own kind of food.  “Just so that you have a good meal the next time you step out”  The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019. The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars.  Phase I,  In Phase I of extraction only the URL, name and address of the restaurant were extracted which were visible on the front page. The URl's for each of the restaurants on the zomato were recorded in the csv file so that later the data can be extracted individually for each restaurant. This made the extraction process easier and reduced the extra load on my machine. The data for each neighborhood and each category can be found here  Phase II,  In Phase II the recorded data for each restaurant and each category was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 15 variables were scraped in this phase. For each of the neighborhood and for each category their onlineorder, booktable, rate, votes, phone, location, resttype, dishliked, cuisines, approxcost(for two people), reviewslist, menu_item was extracted. See section 5 for more details about the variables.  Acknowledgements The data scraped was entirely for educational purposes only. Note that I don’t claim any copyright for the data.

The mobile user's behavior habits often reflect the user's demographic attributes. This article will be based on Python's powerful machine learning module Scikit-learn, through the modeling of a large number of behavioral information classification algorithms, and ultimately achieve predicting demographic through the mobile user behavior habits. This thesis uses the data about 200,000 users provided by TalkingData. The data consists of two parts: one part is gender-age information and it is divided into 12 groups, the other part is the user's behavioral attributes, including time and geographic coordinate information, and mobile phone. The brand and model, the APP installed and used, and the category of the app. This article is based on the above data modeling, and finally realizes that the mobile end user's demographic attributes are predicted according to the behavioral habits. This article is based on open source software Python and NumPy, SciPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn build the environment, the main machine learning methods used are Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. In the modeling phase, 3-fold cross validation was used. The evaluation index of the model is loss function. This article mainly performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and testing, and logloss evaluation, the output and evaluation, etc. This paper provides logistic regression and SVM model implementation methods, as well as specific practical processes, and finally gives the logloss and the optimal model after training. Through specific practices, as far as the models involved in this paper are concerned, after the data reaches an order of magnitude, the SVM algorithm performs very well. The logarithm loss predicted by the model remains below 2.5, but it is a logistic regression algorithm in terms of time. Several times or even dozens of times. In practical applications, certain trade-offs may be made based on accuracy requirements and time requirements.""}",,3
222,https://github.com/Vetrivel-PS/AV-JanataHack-Insurance-Cross-Sell.git,"Your client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.  An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.  For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.  Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.  Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.   Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.",,3

This is a historical customer data where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it’s less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.  This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.  The data set includes information about:  Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents",,3

A premium is a sum of money that you pay regularly to an insurance company for this\xa0 guarantee.\xa0\xa0 For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a medical insurance cover of Rs.\xa0 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance\xa0 provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are\xa0 wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of\xa0 only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you,\xa0 there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a\xa0\xa0 \xa0     few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone.

Similarly, there can be a variety of insurance products for different kinds of\xa0 risks.\xa0 As you can imagine, if a large number of customers do not pay the premium on time, it might\xa0 disrupt the cash flow and smooth operation for the company.

348,https://github.com/prateekpr/HEART-DISEASE-ANALYSIS.git,"{""LOGISTIC REGRESSION - HEART DISEASE PREDICTION  Introduction World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression Data Preparation  Source The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.  Demographic: • Sex: male or female(Nominal) • Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous) Behavioral • Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal) • Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.) Medical( history) • BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal) • Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal) • Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal) • Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal) Medical(current) • Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous) • Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous) • Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous) • BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous) • Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.) • Glucose: glucose level (Continuous) Predict variable (desired target) • 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”) Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis in statistics used for prediction of outcome of a categorical dependent variable from a set of predictor or independent variables. In logistic regression the dependent variable is always binary. Logistic regression is mainly used to for prediction and also calculating the probability of success. The results above show some of the attributes with P value higher than the preferred alpha(5%) and thereby showing low statistically significant relationship with the probability of heart disease. Backward elimination approach is used here to remove those attributes with highest P-value one at a time followed by running the regression repeatedly until all attributes have P Values less than 0.05. Feature Selection: Backward elimination (P-value approach) Logistic regression equation P=eβ0+β1X1/1+eβ0+β1X1P=eβ0+β1X1/1+eβ0+β1X1 When all features plugged in: logit(p)=log(p/(1−p))=β0+β1∗Sexmale+β2∗age+β3∗cigsPerDay+β4∗totChol+β5∗sysBP+β6∗glucoselogit(p)=log(p/(1−p))=β0+β1∗Sexmale+β2∗age+β3∗cigsPerDay+β4∗totChol+β5∗sysBP+β6∗glucose  Interpreting the results: Odds Ratio, Confidence Intervals and P-values • This fitted model shows that, holding all other features constant, the odds of getting diagnosed with heart disease for males (sex_male = 1)over that of females (sex_male = 0) is exp(0.5815) = 1.788687. In terms of percent change, we can say that the odds for males are 78.8% higher than the odds for females. • The coefficient for age says that, holding all others constant, we will see 7% increase in the odds of getting diagnosed with CDH for a one year increase in age since exp(0.0655) = 1.067644. • Similarly , with every extra cigarette one smokes thers is a 2% increase in the odds of CDH. • For Total cholesterol level and glucose level there is no significant change.  • There is a 1.7% increase in odds for every unit increase in systolic Blood Pressure.  Model Evaluation - Statistics From the above statistics it is clear that the model is highly specific than sensitive. The negative values are predicted more accurately than the positives. Predicted probabilities of 0 (No Coronary Heart Disease) and 1 ( Coronary Heart Disease: Yes) for the test data with a default classification threshold of 0.5 lower the threshold Since the model is predicting Heart disease too many type II errors is not advisable. A False Negative ( ignoring the probability of disease when there actually is one) is more dangerous than a False Positive in this case. Hence in order to increase the sensitivity, threshold can be lowered.  Conclusions • All attributes selected after the elimination process show P-values lower than 5% and thereby suggesting significant role in the Heart disease prediction.  • Men seem to be more susceptible to heart disease than women. Increase in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic Blood Pressure also show increasing odds of having heart disease  • Total cholesterol shows no significant change in the odds of CHD. This could be due to the presence of 'good cholesterol(HDL) in the total cholesterol reading. Glucose too causes a very negligible change in odds (0.2%)  • The model predicted with 0.88 accuracy. The model is more specific than sensitive. Overall model could be improved with more data""}",,2
349,https://github.com/bitsenzes/how-to-make-a-successful-mobile-app.git,"{""To make a effective mobile app, one thing you need to keep in mind is:  Determine a problem which may be fixed by your app   choose the features of your app  The app should provide customer with tangible benefits including reducing costs via productivity enhancements, new earnings or enhancing the customer experience.  Step 2: Recognize To create a successful mobile app, you need to identify or be manifest about:  Application target users - An iphone app should be developed keeping in mind the target users of an application. Having a clear vision about the targeted group, enhance the success ratio of your app. Specific factors that should be considered while selecting mobile platforms and devices includes coverage, device support, performance and other features. Revenue model - The app market is booming like no time before. To be able to ensure this resource and generate earnings, app developer need to select appropriate approach in accordance with the app. You can find different models of making earnings from mobile applications including paid applications, separate application and in-app freemiums, commercials, subscription and pay for each download. These techniques can be employed to generate earnings. Direct Revenue Models - used to create successful mobile applications The graph describes a detailed account of application income models From this point you should also think about your budget, the amount of money you wish to set aside for the expansion, marketing and eventual release of your app. This a quick guide to the approximate costs for developing an app.  Action 3: Design your software designing your app to get success in software development  Designing your iphone app is yet another substantial factor in charge of success of an application on the market. An application developer must concentrate on the UI design, multi-touch gestures for touch-enabled devices and consider platform design standards as well. Today, emphasis is on the UI design of an app as it plays an essential role in the success of an app. Step 4: Determine method to develop the iphone app - native, web or cross Selecting the right approach for developing an software is highly important.Preferably, app development method must be in accordance with the time and budget limitations of any client.  Native: Native software permits in delivering the best user experience but require important some talent to be developed. These software are basically program specific and require knowledge along with knowledge. Net: Web software are quick and cheap ones to develop and can run using multiple platforms. These are developed using HTML5, WEB PAGE and JavaScript code. These types of web software are less powerful than native programs. Hybrid: Hybrid approach is the new approach to develop any application.This approach combines prebuilt local containers with on-the-fly web coding in order to achieve the best of both worlds. In this method, the developer augments the internet code with native vocabulary to create unique features and access native APIs which can be not yet available through JavaScript. Step 5: Develop a prototype after identifying the approach is developing a prototype. That is actually the taking your idea and making it an application with some basic functionality.An auto dvd unit makes it quite easier to sell your idea to would-be who can now actually see the concrete benefits rather than just imagining or reading product explanation. It is rather helpful in attracting investors and working with manufacturers and finding licensees  Step 6: Incorporate a suitable analytics tool use analytics to improve your application in order that it results in successful software development   Step seven: Identify beta-testers. Beta testing is the first possibility to get feedback from your target customers. It is particularly significant as it enhances your visibility in the iphone app store. It not only reduce product chance but ensure you get that first push in the software store. To distinguish beta testers is another important job to ensure success of an app.  Preparing for beta launch: Define focus on customer - It truly is highly important to identify and clearly define your targeted audience. This will allow you identify the right testers during your beta tester recruiting. Eliminate insects - Before beta screening your iphone app on different platforms you need to take into account vast majority of the devices which eliminate device specific insects. Identify goals - Beta testing is the best possibility to get real feedback from target customers. It provides a great chance to further understand marketplace and their requirements. Discovering goals for beta screening helps in focusing the efforts. These goals reduce your product launch chance. Step 8: Release and deploy the software Implementing an app requires plan, schedule and control over the movement of releases to test and live conditions. The objective of Deployment Management is to ensure the integrity of the live environment is protected and that the correct components are released.  Step 9: Capture the metrics There has recently been substantial rise in the mobile app users in today's decade. As a result, the need to accumulate accurate metrics is highly important. As the amount of consumers using mobile applications steadily rises, the need to gather precise metrics from them is increasingly important. Unfortunately, many of the methods used to measure programs are taken from web stats. Funnel analysis signifies why users are failing to finish desired user actions including in-app purchases or ad clicks Measuring social discussing signifies what aspects of your application are recording the interest of your users Correlating demographic data with user behaviour Step 10: Upgrade your application with improvements and new features update and upgrade your mobile after you know that you have developed it properly - the last step to successful software development  After capturing the metrics it becomes important to upgrade your app with advancements and revolutionary features. A new mobile iphone app without modern features loses its user friendliness extended range run. Upgrading your iphone app with innovative features enhances its visibility along with downloads of an app.""}",,2

While this industry consists of film, print, radio, television, video games, and  music, we will take a look at topics particularly relating to digital media and entertainment. Most of the  advances in this industry have been in streaming platforms for music and television, as well as  breakthroughs in Hollywood film production and gaming. We will discuss these developments and how  the use of artificial intelligence and cognitive technologies continues to be a driving factor in company  competitiveness and sustainability. This is an industry where offering broad, generalized services is no  longer the standard – with both services and advertising. With music and television streaming services,  like Netflix and Spotify, we discuss how these industry leaders use personalized content and  recommendations to serve both their customers and their advertisers. In the past, advertisers would pay to  have their ads randomly played between breaks of a show’s episode; but now, ads are tailored to specific  viewers based on factors like age, if you are a parent, gender, etc. based on specific shows that are geared  to certain demographics. Not only can companies see an increase of sales and website traffic due to this  customization, users can come across products and services that otherwise they may not have heard about  that would benefit their lifestyle; plus, streaming services are able to increase the advertising fee due to  this customization, boosting advertising revenue. It is a win-win for all involved.   We also interview a small movie director, who has noticed and benefited from this technology first hand.  We will discuss his experience with these technological advances in this field. As great as these  technologies are, this industry also faces just as many challenges as they do opportunities.

Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget. The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. The dataset has data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you\'ve finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you\'ve become the Chief Data Scientist for your city\'s school district. In this capacity, you\'ll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.  As a first task, you\'ve been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You\'ll be given access to every student\'s math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.  Your final report should include each of the following:  ### District Summary  * Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district\'s key metrics, including:   * Total Schools   * Total Students   * Total Budget   * Average Math Score   * Average Reading Score   * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)   * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)   * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)  ### School Summary  * Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:   * School Name   * School Type   * Total Students   * Total School Budget   * Per Student Budget   * Average Math Score   * Average Reading Score   * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)   * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)   * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)  ### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)  * Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:   * School Name   * School Type   * Total Students   * Total School Budget   * Per Student Budget   * Average Math Score   * Average Reading Score   * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)   * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)   * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)  ### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)  * Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.  ### Math Scores by Grade\\*\\*  * Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.  ### Reading Scores by Grade  * Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.  ### Scores by School Spending  * Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:   * Average Math Score   * Average Reading Score   * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)   * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)   * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)  ### Scores by School Size  * Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).  ### Scores by School Type  * Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).  As final considerations:  * Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook. * You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames. * You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data. * See [Example Solution](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) for a reference on the expected format.  ## Hints and Considerations  * These are challenging activities for a number of reasons. For one, these activities will require you to analyze thousands of records. Hacking through the data to look for obvious trends in Excel is just not a feasible option. The size of the data may seem daunting, but pandas will allow you to efficiently parse through it.  * Second, these activities will also challenge you by requiring you to learn on your feet. Don\'t fool yourself into thinking: ""I need to study pandas more closely before diving in."" Get the basic gist of the library and then _immediately_ get to work. When facing a daunting task, it\'s easy to think: ""I\'m just not ready to tackle it yet."" But that\'s the surest way to never succeed. Learning to program requires one to constantly tinker, experiment, and learn on the fly. You are doing exactly the _right_ thing, if you find yourself constantly practicing Google-Fu and diving into documentation. There is just no way (or reason) to try and memorize it all. Online references are available for you to use when you need them. So use them!  * Take each of these tasks one at a time. Begin your work, answering the basic questions: ""How do I import the data?"" ""How do I convert the data into a DataFrame?"" ""How do I build the first table?"" Don\'t get intimidated by the number of asks. Many of them are repetitive in nature with just a few tweaks. Be persistent and creative!  * Expect these exercises to take time! Don\'t get discouraged if you find yourself spending  hours initially with little progress. Force yourself to deal with the discomfort of not knowing and forge ahead. Consider these hours an investment in your future!  * As always, feel encouraged to work in groups and get help from your TAs and Instructor. Just remember, true success comes from mastery and _not_ a completed homework assignment. So challenge yourself to truly succeed!  ### Copyright  Trilogy Education Services © 2019.

877,https://github.com/atanu1982/HIPAA-HHS-PHI-2017-Updates-Security-Rule-Penalties-Violations.git,"The Privacy Rule issued by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") Goal - strikes a balance between protecting individuals\' health information and allowing/permiting the flow of health information needed to provide quality health care.  Regulates - address the use and disclosure of individuals\' health information - called ""protected health information"" by organizations subject to the Privacy Rule called ""covered entities,"" as well as standards for individuals\' privacy rights to understand and control how their health information is used.    The HIPAA Rules provide federal protections for patient health information held by Covered Entities (CEs) and Business Associates (BAs). The HIPAA Privacy Rule covers protected health information in any medium while the HIPAA Security Rule covers electronic protected health information. Personal health information or protected health information (PHI) Refers to demographic information, medical history, test and laboratory results, insurance information and other data that a healthcare professional collects to identify an individual and determine appropriate care.   Requirements of PHI Any health information information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual: That identifies the individual; or With respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual HIPAA - Ignorance of the law is NO defence for being out of compliance The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule set national standards requiring organizations and individuals to implement certain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).   HIPAA violations Four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability Four corresponding tiers of penalties that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation A maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision  Penalties for HIPAA violations Applies to both covered entities and individuals Determined by the Office for Civil Rights and by state Attorney Generals is generally not be exclusively financial can result in civil and criminal penalties progressive disciplinary actions can include termination covered entities include healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and all other CEs - including Business Associates (BAs) of CEs  HIPAA Security Rule - Need for HIPAA Security Rule  Ensuring implementation of appropriate security safeguards and protective measures for electronic health care information that may be at risk Protecting an individual\'s health information, while permitting the appropriate access and use of that information, promoting the use of electronic health information in the industry The Security Rule applies only to electronic protected health information (ePHI), ensuring the data\'s. Confidentiality - EPHI is accessible only by authorized people and processes Integrity - EPHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner Availability - EPHI can be accessed as needed by an authorized person  Who needs to comply with Security Rule? HIPAA - covered entities and and business associates of covered entities who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards.   HIPAA - covered entities are: Covered Health Care Providers - Any provider of medical or other health care services or supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form Health care clearinghouses - A public or private entity, that process health information from nonstandard data format into standard data elements or vice-versa. Includes billing service, repricing company, community health management information system or community health information system Health care providers - A provider of medical or health services and any other person or organization who furnishes, bills, or is paid for health care  What makes up Security Rule? There are 3 parts of the Security Rule that covered entities must know about:  Physical safeguards - includes mechanisms required to protect electronic systems, equipment and the data they hold, from threats, environmental hazards and unauthorized intrusion. They include restricting access to EPHI and retaining off site computer backups Technical safeguards - the automated processes used to protect data and control access to data. They include using authentication controls to verify that the person signing onto a computer is authorized to access that EPHI, or encrypting and decrypting data as it is being stored and/or transmitted Administrative safeguards - includes items such assignment or delegation of security responsibility to an individual and security training requirements.....https://www.complyarena.com/articledetails/40",,1
