This guide will benefit BI and analytics pros, data scientists, business execs and project managers. Start Download In computing, databases are sometimes classified according to their organizational approach. The most prevalent approach is the relational database, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. A distributed database is one that can be dispersed or replicated among different points in a network. An object-oriented programming database is one that is congruent with the data defined in object classes and subclasses.  Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as sales transactions, product catalogs and inventories, and customer profiles. Typically, a database manager provides users the capabilities of controlling read/write access, specifying report generation, and analyzing usage. Databases and database managers are prevalent in large mainframe systems, but are also present in smaller distributed workstation and mid-range systems such as the AS/400 and on personal computers. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for making interactive queries from and updating a database such as IBM's DB2, Microsoft's SQL Server, and database products from Oracle, Sybase, and Computer Associates.""}",,9

657,https://github.com/AlexNewcombe/Australian-National-Electricity-Market-with-and-without-flexible-ramping-products.git,"Australia\'s goals of increased penetration of renewable energy such as wind energy will inevitably lead to increased variability and uncertainty of the ramps in net load (load minus non-dispatchable renewable generation).  This increased variability and uncertainty requires conventional generators to be more flexible, but currently this flexibility is not fully integrated in market processes. The provision of additional flexibility may cause a reduction in economic efficiency, consumer surplus and/or producer surplus as conventional generators may need to modify their output from the optimal level in order to provide flexibility to account for future variability and uncertainty. As a solution to this problem, the Midwest and Californian Independent System Operators have proposed flexible ramping products as a mechanism to manage the uncertainty and variability in net load ramps in an economically preferable manner. The mechanism essentially aims to schedule conventional generators to provide enough ramping capability, or ""flexibility"", to satisfy a flexible ramping capability requirement. This requirement is designed to ensure a certain range of ramps in the next interval could be met, whether the ramps actually occur or not. This study aims to explore the implementation of flexible ramping products in the specific context of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), to determine whether or not they can be an effective mechanism for integrating variable renewable energy in Australia in the coming decades. This model is a simplified model of the Australian NEM, in which a unit commitment and economic dispatch is designed with flexible ramping products and a flexible ramping requirement. The simplification of the NEM includes a grouping of the five states into two regions, and an aggregation of generators by offered ramping speed and actual marginal costs. Actual load and wind generation data from the 2014/15 financial year is implemented in the model to attempt to simulate the market in a realistic manner.",,4

This guide will benefit BI and analytics pros, data scientists, business execs and project managers. Start Download In computing, databases are sometimes classified according to their organizational approach. The most prevalent approach is the relational database, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. A distributed database is one that can be dispersed or replicated among different points in a network. An object-oriented programming database is one that is congruent with the data defined in object classes and subclasses.  Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as sales transactions, product catalogs and inventories, and customer profiles. Typically, a database manager provides users the capabilities of controlling read/write access, specifying report generation, and analyzing usage. Databases and database managers are prevalent in large mainframe systems, but are also present in smaller distributed workstation and mid-range systems such as the AS/400 and on personal computers. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for making interactive queries from and updating a database such as IBM's DB2, Microsoft's SQL Server, and database products from Oracle, Sybase, and Computer Associates.""}",,9

1577,https://github.com/AlexNewcombe/Australian-National-Electricity-Market-with-and-without-flexible-ramping-products.git,"Australia\'s goals of increased penetration of renewable energy such as wind energy will inevitably lead to increased variability and uncertainty of the ramps in net load (load minus non-dispatchable renewable generation).  This increased variability and uncertainty requires conventional generators to be more flexible, but currently this flexibility is not fully integrated in market processes. The provision of additional flexibility may cause a reduction in economic efficiency, consumer surplus and/or producer surplus as conventional generators may need to modify their output from the optimal level in order to provide flexibility to account for future variability and uncertainty. As a solution to this problem, the Midwest and Californian Independent System Operators have proposed flexible ramping products as a mechanism to manage the uncertainty and variability in net load ramps in an economically preferable manner. The mechanism essentially aims to schedule conventional generators to provide enough ramping capability, or ""flexibility"", to satisfy a flexible ramping capability requirement. This requirement is designed to ensure a certain range of ramps in the next interval could be met, whether the ramps actually occur or not. This study aims to explore the implementation of flexible ramping products in the specific context of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), to determine whether or not they can be an effective mechanism for integrating variable renewable energy in Australia in the coming decades. This model is a simplified model of the Australian NEM, in which a unit commitment and economic dispatch is designed with flexible ramping products and a flexible ramping requirement. The simplification of the NEM includes a grouping of the five states into two regions, and an aggregation of generators by offered ramping speed and actual marginal costs. Actual load and wind generation data from the 2014/15 financial year is implemented in the model to attempt to simulate the market in a realistic manner.",,4
