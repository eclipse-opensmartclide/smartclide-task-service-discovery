From there we run image processing at the edge on these IoT device using OpenCV and TensorFlow to determine attributes and image analytics.

The JSON data (with it's schema referenced from a central Schema Registry) is routed and routed using Record Processing and SQL, this data in enriched and augment before conversion to AVRO to be send via Apache Kafka to SAM.
