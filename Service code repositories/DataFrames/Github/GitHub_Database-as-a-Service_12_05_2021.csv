Extending functionality without compromising the security.  Personal banking services that gives you complete control over all your banking demands online.  Simple and easy user interface to work with.  Online Banking features: Registration for online banking by Admin.  Adding Beneficiary account by customer.  Transferring amount to the beneficiary added by customer.  Staff must approve for beneficiary activation before it can be used for transferring funds.  Customer gets to know his last login date and time each time he logs in.  Customer can check last 10 transactions made with their account.  Customer can check their account statement within a date range.  Customer can request for ATM and Cheque Book.  Staff will approve requests for ATM card and cheque book.  Admin can add/edit/delete customer as well as staff.  All three of them(customer, staff & admin) can change their password.  Staff and Admin Login pages are hidden from customer for security purpose.  Security: Each and every input is passed through mysql_real_escape_string() to remove special characters from the string so that user can’t submit arbitrary input. It protects from attacks like Sql Injection and Cross Site Scripting(XSS).  Passwords are encrypted with SHA- 1 hashing algorithm and then stored in database.  Passwords are stored as encrypted hashes with an additional random salt for added security.  Note: If we talk about security,above mentioned points would provide no security at all but it will work for beginners. Being into web app pentesting,I very well know this project will not be considered secure. It needs atleast a more effective filtering mechanism, better hashing algorithm, a better salting procedure for storing passwords and some other things too.  Database: The database contains customer, staff & admin tables.  Each customer has its own virtual passbook linked with its account number.  Staff, customer and, admin have their details and password in their respective tables with all the details.  A separate table for beneficiary is included in the database.  A table for cheque book and ATM requests is included.  This project is divided into three hierarchical parts:  The index page for the customer login.  A hidden staff login page.  A hidden admin login page.  Usage: 1.Install XAMPP or something similar.  2.Copy all the files to c:/xampp/htdocs/banking/  3.Create a db named as 'bnak_db' and import the bank_db.sql from phpMyAdmin.  4.change the password in _inc/dbconn.php file accordingly.  5.visit localhost/banking (customer index page)  6.visit localhost/banking/adminlogin.php (admin login)  7.visit the localhost/banking/staff_login.php (staff login)""}",,28

40,https://github.com/mudigosa/Image-Classifier.git,"Image Classifier  Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you\'d use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.  In this project, you\'ll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you\'d train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We\'ll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.  When you\'ve completed this project, you\'ll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset.  This is the final Project of the Udacity AI with Python Nanodegree Prerequisites  The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don\'t have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.  To install pip run in the command Line  python -m ensurepip -- default-pip  to upgrade it  python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel  to upgrade Python  pip install python -- upgrade  Additional Packages that are required are: Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Pytorch, PIL and json. You can donwload them using pip  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pil  or conda  conda install numpy pandas matplotlib pil  In order to intall Pytorch head over to the Pytorch site select your specs and follow the instructions given. Viewing the Jyputer Notebook  In order to better view and work on the jupyter Notebook I encourage you to use nbviewer . You can simply copy and paste the link to this website and you will be able to edit it without any problem. Alternatively you can clone the repository using  git clone https://github.com/fotisk07/Image-Classifier/  then in the command Line type, after you have downloaded jupyter notebook type  jupyter notebook  locate the notebook and run it. Command Line Application      Train a new network on a data set with train.py         Basic Usage : python train.py data_directory         Prints out current epoch, training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the netowrk trains         Options:             Set direcotry to save checkpoints: python train.py data_dor --save_dir save_directory             Choose arcitecture (alexnet, densenet121 or vgg16 available): pytnon train.py data_dir --arch ""vgg16""             Set hyperparameters: python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_layer1 120 --epochs 20             Use GPU for training: python train.py data_dir --gpu gpu      Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name. That is you\'ll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability         Basic usage: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint         Options:             Return top K most likely classes: python predict.py input checkpoint ---top_k 3             Use a mapping of categories to real names: python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_To_name.json             Use GPU for inference: python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu  Json file  In order for the network to print out the name of the flower a .json file is required. If you aren\'t familiar with json you can find information here. By using a .json file the data can be sorted into folders with numbers and those numbers will correspond to specific names specified in the .json file. Data and the json file  The data used specifically for this assignemnt are a flower database are not provided in the repository as it\'s larger than what github allows. Nevertheless, feel free to create your own databases and train the model on them to use with your own projects. The structure of your data should be the following: The data need to comprised of 3 folders, test, train and validate. Generally the proportions should be 70% training 10% validate and 20% test. Inside the train, test and validate folders there should be folders bearing a specific number which corresponds to a specific category, clarified in the json file. For example if we have the image a.jpj and it is a rose it could be in a path like this /test/5/a.jpg and json file would be like this {...5:""rose"",...}. Make sure to include a lot of photos of your catagories (more than 10) with different angles and different lighting conditions in order for the network to generalize better. GPU  As the network makes use of a sophisticated deep convolutional neural network the training process is impossible to be done by a common laptop. In order to train your models to your local machine you have three options      Cuda -- If you have an NVIDIA GPU then you can install CUDA from here. With Cuda you will be able to train your model however the process will still be time consuming     Cloud Services -- There are many paid cloud services that let you train your models like AWS or Google Cloud     Coogle Colab -- Google Colab gives you free access to a tesla K80 GPU for 12 hours at a time. Once 12 hours have ellapsed you can just reload and continue! The only limitation is that you have to upload the data to Google Drive and if the dataset is massive you may run out of space.  However, once a model is trained then a normal CPU can be used for the predict.py file and you will have an answer within some seconds. Hyperparameters  As you can see you have a wide selection of hyperparameters available and you can get even more by making small modifications to the code. Thus it may seem overly complicated to choose the right ones especially if the training needs at least 15 minutes to be completed. So here are some hints:      By increasing the number of epochs the accuracy of the network on the training set gets better and better however be careful because if you pick a large number of epochs the network won\'t generalize well, that is to say it will have high accuracy on the training image and low accuracy on the test images. Eg: training for 12 epochs training accuracy: 85% Test accuracy: 82%. Training for 30 epochs training accuracy 95% test accuracy 50%.     A big learning rate guarantees that the network will converge fast to a small error but it will constantly overshot     A small learning rate guarantees that the network will reach greater accuracies but the learning process will take longer     Densenet121 works best for images but the training process takes significantly longer than alexnet or vgg16  *My settings were lr=0.001, dropoup=0.5, epochs= 15 and my test accuracy was 86% with densenet121 as my feature extraction model. Pre-Trained Network  The checkpoint.pth file contains the information of a network trained to recognise 102 different species of flowers. I has been trained with specific hyperparameters thus if you don\'t set them right the network will fail. In order to have a prediction for an image located in the path /path/to/image using my pretrained model you can simply type python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint.pth Contributing  Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for the process for submitting pull requests.

The primary aim of Pharmacy Management System is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock. Pharmacy Management system is useful to maintain correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock. It is used to manage most pharmacy related activities in the pharmacy.        Pharmacy Management System is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. Using this pharmacy management system user is also able to generate report within a specified period of time. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period. Pharmacy management system is being build. Pharmacy management system is robust, integrated technology. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly. ",,12

48,https://github.com/ritabratamaiti/Blooddonorprediction.git,"Thanks to digitization, we often have access to large databases, consisting of various fields of information, ranging from numbers to texts and even boolean values. Such databases lend themselves especially well to machine learning, classification and big data analysis tasks. We are able to train classifiers, using already existing data and use them for predicting the values of a certain field, given that we have information regarding the other fields. Most specifically, in this study, we look at the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that are compiled by hospitals. These EHRs are convenient means of accessing data of individual patients, but there processing as a whole still remains a task. However, EHRs that are composed of coherent, well-tabulated structures lend themselves quite well to the application to machine language, via the usage of classifiers. In this study, we look at a Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set (Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan). We used scikit-learn machine learning in python. From Support Vector Machines(SVM), we use Support Vector Classification(SVC), from the linear model we import Perceptron. We also used the K.neighborsclassifier and the decision tree classifiers. We segmented the database into the 2 parts. Using the first, we trained the classifiers and the next part was used to verify if the classifier prediction matched that of the actual values.","ehr,classifier,machine-learning,scikit-learn,tpot,decision-tree-classifier,support-vector-machine",8

62,https://github.com/ariels7801/spring5webapp.git,"This is the most modern and comprehensive course available for Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.   All source code examples used in this course have been developed using the latest version of the Spring Framework - Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.  In this course, you will build multiple real world applications using Spring Framework 5.   You will see how modern Spring Framework development is done by leveraging the features of Spring Boot 2.   Jump In and Build a Spring MVC App with Spring Boot!  We\'ll jump right into web development with the Spring Framework. I\'ll show you how kick off a Spring Boot project by using the Spring Initializr. We will then go step by step to build a simple Book / Author web application.   You will see how easy it is to use Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA to create a functional web application running under Tomcat with a H2 in-memory database.  Use Test Driven Development!  In addition to teaching you Spring Framework 5, you will learn about modern best practices used in enterprise application development.   As we build the applications, you\'ll see me using Test Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit and Mockito.  Using Mockito mocks keeps your Spring Framework unit tests light and fast!  You\'ll also see how the Spring context can be used for more complex integration tests.  These techniques are best practices used by companies all over the world to build and manage large scale Spring Framework applications.  GitHub Source Code  You will have complete access to all source code examples used in the course.  In each lesson where we write code, you will have a link to GitHub with two branches in the Github repository.   The first branch is the starting state of the code.   The second branch is the ending state of the code.   You can see exactly what changed in each lesson. Each step of the way, you have a working example you can use for troubleshooting.  In fact, you will get access to 15 (and growing!) different GitHub repositories - each packed with Spring Framework programming examples.   And, you\'re encouraged to fork my GitHub repositories so you can share the Spring Framework applications, which you built, to future employers!   Continuous Integration Builds  Since we are using GitHub and have great test coverage, I also show you how easy it is to set up Continuous Integration builds with CircleCI.   Continuous Integration builds are another best practice used by enterprise developers.   Using CircleCI makes your CI builds a snap!  Project Lombok  We all know Java development can require a lot of boiler plate code. It\'s just the nature of Java.  Would you like to see how to slash your boiler plate code using Project Lombok?  Spring Data JPA and Hibernate  Spring MVC and Hibernate have long been cornerstones of the Spring Framework. You will learn how to use Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to build a real world web application. You\'ll learn about Hibernate configuration, and about the mapping of JPA entities.   The Thymeleaf template engine is hugely popular with the Spring community. You will see how easy Spring Boot makes using Thymeleaf with Spring MVC.  While Bootstrap CSS is not a focus of the course, we will leverage Bootstrap CSS to make our web pages look awesome!  Spring MVC  Spring MVC has a lot of robust capabilities.  I start you off showing you how to build recipe application (using TDD, of course).   Initially, it\'s all happy path development. We go back and add custom exception handling, form validation, and internationalization.  Reactive Programming  A big theme of Spring Framework 5 is Reactive Programming.   Inside the course we build a web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, Spring Data MongoDB, and MongoDB.  We then take the MongoDB application we built and convert it to a Reactive application. You\'ll see how you can leverage the new Reactive types inside the Spring Framework from the data tier to the web tier.  You will get to see step by step how to convert a traditional Spring MVC application to an end to end reactive application using the WebFlux framework - which is brand new to Spring Framework 5.  Coming Soon to the Course  I plan to add a lot more content to this course!   I want this to be your go-to course for becoming a Spring Framework developer.  Coming soon to the course in 2017:  Building RESTFul APIs with Spring WebFlux (New in Spring Framework 5!) Spring Security Documenting your APIs with RestDoc and Swagger 2 Aspect Oriented Programming Using Spring Events Scheduling Tasks Using JAXB Caching with eHcache Spring JDBC (JDBC Template) Spring RestTemplate JMS Messaging AMQP with RabbitMQ Logging configuration for Logback and Log4J 2 And more real world Spring Framework apps!

See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet — September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  ☰ Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group\'s work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff\'s exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C\'s payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo\'s Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group\'s first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C\'s auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C\'s Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We\'re now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C\'s Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C\'s Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C\'s MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",,6

74,https://github.com/stephenpfahy/web-applications-project.git,"{""This is a repository for the project for the Web Applications module for the Higher Diploma in Science (Software Development). It is a client based website which was built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The website is connected to a relational database via PHP  which inserts, reads, updates, and deletes information entered by the user from the website into the relational database. The relational database used was created for the Database Design & Development Module. Stephen Fahy G00172772 WEB SITE DESIGN 13/12/2015  The projectmain file contains all the files for my South Dublin Housing Council website.  This consists of my six html5 webpages.  There is a homepage, a tenants page, a property page, a repairs page, a tradesman page and an equipment page. Each webpage is linked to each other by a sidebar on every webpage with links to the other pages.  You enter the website via the homepage which then can access all the other webpages of the website.  In the projectmain file there is the css file whch contains the external css design for the website,  a images file which contains the images for my website, a js file which contains the javascript for the website,  and a php file which contains the php insert statements and select statements for each webpage except the homepage.  The website is linked to a database via HTML5 forms and my php code on each webpage except the homepage.  The database can be accessed by opening the south_dublin_housing_council_repairs file which contains the datafiles or  by importing the south_dublin_housing_council_repairs.sql file into your phpadmin in mysql.  The website is designed for South Dublin Housing Council's employees so that they can view and update the council's database. The employees access the website via the council's private intranet network which can be used in the main South Dublin Housing Council building in Tallaght  or in other council buildings in South Dublin. The employees access the website via the homepage which accesses the other webpages.  On the other 5 webpages employees can view the council's database or they can update it.  The majority of the website css design was done in an external css file in completesite.css. There was internal css design done in the website such as the table on the homepage using the <style> tag and  there was inline css design using the style attribute such as the paragraph on line 108 on the property webpage.  Javascript was used to add a link to googlemaps on the property page website so users could view the south Dublin area in Google maps.  Php insert and select statements were used to update and view data in the database from a website.  The php insert and select statements were used in all the pages except the homepage.  All my html5 files have been validated using w3c markup validation service.  The website is functional in all browsers but is best viewed in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.  CHANGES TO THE WEBSITE FROM THE WEBSITE DESIGN. The website design was not changed when the website was being created, but there was some slight changes made. They changes made are as follows: 1. In the property table the TENANT column was changed to TENANT_ID to have the same name has the TENANT_ID primary key in the tenant table. 2. In the property table the REPAIRS column was changed to REPAIR_ID to have the same name has the REPAIR_ID primary key in the repairs table. 3. In the repairs table the TRADEMAN column was changed to TRADESMAN_ID to have the same name has the TRADESMAN_ID primary key in the tradesman table. 4. In the trademan table the AVAILABILITY column was removed as the information provided with this column conflicted with information in the DATE and    TIME columns in the repairs table. 5. In the tradesman table the EQUIPMENT column was changed to EQUIPMENT_ID to have the same name has the EQUIPMENT_ID primary key in the equipment table. 6. In the homepage of the website a table and extra headings were added to section div tag.     Also a link was added to this section to bring the user to the next webpage. 7. In the tenant page there were a few changes made to the section div tag.     A few extra paragrahs were added and links to view the database were added.    There was a link added to go to next page. 8. In the property page there were a few changes made to the sectin div.    A few extra paragraphs were added and links to view the database and to go to the homepage were added. 9. A javascript link to view google maps was added to the property page. 10.In the repairs page a few extra paragraphs were added and links to view the database and a link to go to the next page. 11.In the tradesman page a few extra paragraphs were added and links to view the database and a link to go to the next page. 12.In the equipment page a few extra paragraphs were added and links to view the database and a link to go to the next page.""}",,5

84,https://github.com/shajulin/micromon.git,"micromon: A microservice oriented performance monitoring tool for Cloud Applications.   Overall Description: micromon is a golang based logging service. Detailed Description: Users could submit the event information to micromon service. This information will be stored in mongodb based database named micromonDB. Later, they could collect the processing time of events.  The micromon package consists of the following folders (FOLDER/Source information):  micromon     -addevent (addevent interface)       This interface adds events to the micromon service.       Usage: (from terminal)       curl -d \'{""AppID"":""ID-1"",""QueryID"":""q1"",""EventName"":""RegisterStudent"",""TimeStamp"":""23.1"",""AdditionalInfo"":""TUMStudent""}\' -i http://localhost:8172/addevent      -CMD (main)       This folder contains the main package of micromon service.      -config (future)     -doc (documentation)      -driver (driver interface)       This folder contains driver.go file. This is an example written in order to       demonstrate how the micromon service could be accessed and the processing time       for events could be retrieved from micromonDB.      -getproctime (driver interface)       THis interface is responsible for getting the processing time of the events.       To utilize this service via. terminal,       curl -d \'{""AppID"":""ID-1"",""QueryID"":""q2"",""EventName"":""RegisterStudent"",""TimeStamp"":""29.1"",""AdditionalInfo"":""HPCCLoudStudent""}\' -i http://localhost:8172/getproctime       If invoked via. browser, the information about utilizing this service will be displayed.       In this service, the user has to specify the current timestamp in seconds or milliseconds       along with the queryid (Mandatory).       It searches for the first entry of this queryid and calculates the processing time for       the event and reports the same to the user.      -getallevent (getallevent interface)       This interface reports all entries of the events that were added to the mrimondb earlier.       THe output is reported to the user in the json format.      -micromonDB (database folder)       This is the folder which stores the event information.      -servicediscovery (future)       This folder is kept for the future use.  How to use micromon service?     Users could utilize in three different ways: i) via. web ii) via. client terminal iii) via. programs       i) via. web:         The services could be contacted using the respective urls. FOr eg. http://localhost:port/addevent         Only limited services are provided with this option.       ii) via. client terminal         The services could be accessed via. the client terminal using curl operations. Pls. see         above for more information.       iii) via. programs.         Users could write a program to utilize micromon service. To do so, the users have to do the         following in their programs (although the programs could be written in any of the languages):           a) connect to the service           b) submit the json encoded EventInfo datastructure in bytes to the services.           c) collect the output and parse the output as per their needs.       A sample example is written in golang which is available in the driver folder.",,4

Most of the top-rated movies in the International movie database (IMDB) are critically acclaimed and are generally a safe bet in terms of commercial success. Naturally, it would be interesting to investigate if these top movies have some distinct features responsible for their high ratings. This project aims to find out the type of natural cluster that exists among the top 250 movies from IMDB. Unsupervised machine learning techniques will be employed, more specifically, clustering algorithms. Hopefully, these clusters will give us information to observe the recurrent pattern. To build our dataset we used OMDB's web API which is RESTful web service to obtain movie information. For plot summaries we scrapped a movie's plot from IMDB's website using BeautifulSoup Library in python. Our final extracted dataframe had 250 rows and 113 columns. The inputs to our dataframe were all categorical features which were one hot encoded. We first used dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA which was followed by K-Means and DB-SCAN clustering to find inherent clusters in the data.""}",,4
87,https://github.com/Aghoreshwar/Awesome-Customer-Analytics.git,"Customer analytics has been one of hottest buzzwords for years. Few years back it was only marketing department’s monopoly carried out with limited volumes of customer data, which was stored in relational databases like Oracle or appliances like Teradata and Netezza. SAS & SPSS were the leaders in providing customer analytics but it was restricted to conducting segmentation of customers who are likely to buy your products or services. In the 90’s came web analytics, it was more popular for page hits, time on sessions, use of cookies for visitors and then using that for customer analytics.  By the late 2000s, Facebook, Twitter and all the other socialchannels changed the way people interacted with brands and each other. Businesses needed to have a presence on the major social sites to stay relevant. With the digital age things have changed drastically. Customer issuperman now. Their mobile interactions have increased substantially and they leave digital footprint everywhere they go. They are more informed, more connected, always on and looking for exceptionally simple and easy experience. This tsunami of data has changed the customer analytics forever. Today customer analytics is not only restricted to marketing forchurn and retention but more focus is going on how to improve thecustomer experience and is done by every department of the organization. A lot of companies had problems integrating large bulk of customer data between various databases and warehouse systems. They are not completely sure of which key metrics to use for profiling customers. Hence creating customer 360 degree view became the foundation for customer analytics. It can capture all customer interactions which can be used for further analytics.  From the technology perspective, the biggest change is the introduction of big data platforms which can do the analytics very fast on all the data organization has, instead of sampling and segmentation. Then came Cloud based platforms, which can scale up and down as per the need of analysis, so companies didn’t have to invest upfront on infrastructure. Predictive models of customer churn, Retention, Cross-Sell do exist today as well, but they run against more data than ever before. Even analytics has further evolved from descriptive to predictive to prescriptive. Only showing what will happen next is not helping anymore but what actions you need to take is becoming more critical.  There are various ways customer analytics is carried out:  Acquiring all the customer data Understanding the customer journey Applying big data concepts to customer relationships Finding high propensity prospects Upselling by identifying related products and interests Generating customer loyalty by discovering response patterns Predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) Identifying dissatisfied customers & churn patterns Applying predictive analytics Implementing continuous improvement Hyper-personalization is the center stage now which gives your customer the right message, on the right platform, using the right channel, at the right time. Now via Cognitive computing and Artificial Intelligence using IBM Watson, Microsoft and Google cognitive services, customer analytics will become sharper as their deep learning neural network algorithms provide a game changing aspect. Tomorrow there may not be just plain simple customer sentiment analytics based on feedback or surveys or social media, but with help of cognitive it may be what customer’s facial expressions show in real time.

111,https://github.com/Yogapriya2512/A-Simple-Chatbot-.git,"A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity)The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called The Policeman\'s Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).  One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.  Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.  Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).  According to Forrester (2015), AI will replace 16 percent of American jobs by the end of the decade.Chatbots have been used in applications such as customer service, sales and product education. However, a study conducted by Narrative Science in 2015 found that 80 percent of their respondents believe AI improves worker performance and creates jobs.[citation needed] is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.  The term ""ChatterBot"" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or via individual organizations\' apps and websites. Chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.

This will not only help farmers but also wholesale buyers of crops and give them access to more options thus creating a better interconected network for business.   To acieve the first objective, we implement Machine Learning and Predictive Data Modeling on the dataset collected for the previous years for all the crops from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) arm of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Data is refined as per requirement so that it gives a list of best suited crops in descending order for the farmer based on key input parameters namely Zip Code, State, Farming Area, Time Duration, Amount Invested and Expected Returns. Using the suggestion from the Machine Learning algorithm, the farmer can make a well informed decision about the crop he's most likely to receive maximum profits from.  The second objective involves giving the farmer the ability to list his crop on an online market place and place a minimum value of his produce as per his calculations. That is the minimum bid at which the farmer can make the sale. Once the crop is placed on the market place, a buyer anywhere in the nation will be able to see the listed crop and place a bid accordingly. Firebase Database instance is used to store the crop data for all farmers and the consequent bidding process. Blockchain is implemented to approve the transactions in real time and make the entire process as seamless as possible.  The inspiration behind this project is to create something to serve the farmers who even after putting in so much effort into their fields end up losing huge sums of money becasue of insufficient information. We believe in serving and creating a better community and improving the lives of people by doing our part in the bigger scheme of things.""}",,3
115,https://github.com/Mikael/VIPBot.git,"If you already know everything about hosting a bot, you can skip this text file. If not, I\'ll quickly run through the process of creating a Discord Bot account with you so you can get started with your own custom Discord bot. Also I\'ll give you a brief overview of the possible ways to host a bot.   == 1) CREATING A DISCORD BOT ACCOUNT == You need a Discord bot account to be able to run the code I\'ve written for you. - Make sure you\'re logged on the Discord *website* here: https://discord.com/ - Open up this page in your web browser: https://discord.com/developers/applications - Click the ""New Application"" button on the top right. - Give your application a name and then click ""Create"". - Create a Bot account by navigating to the ""Bot"" tab and clicking ""Add Bot"". - If you want your bot to be able to invited by others, tick the ""Public Bot"" checkbox. - Copy the Token using the ""Copy"" button. - Replace TOKEN in the config.json with the bot token you just copied. WARNING: Do not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES share this Token with anyone as it\'s like a password for your bot. A Discord employee will never ask for it. Also, if your Bot is public and someone gets hold of the Token, they can wreak havoc on any server that the bot is on, including potentially deleting all messages. If your Token got leaked, make sure to click ""Regnerate"" as fast as possible to minimize the damage.   == 2) INVITING THE BOT TO YOUR SERVER == Now that your bot has been created, you can invite it to your server. - Now click the ""OAuth2"" tab on the application page you were on for creating your bot. - Tick the ""bot"" checkbox under ""Scopes"" - Tick the permissions your bot will need to function properly. You can find the necessary permissions in the text file called ""Needed permissions.txt"" - you can also give your bot the Administrator permission, but keep in mind that this means that the bot has every possible permission. - In the ""Scopes"" section you will find the link to invite your bot to any server that you have the ""Manage Server"" permission on.   == 3) HOSTING THE BOT == There are in general two ways to host your bot: Either you host the bot yourself on your computer (or any other local machine you have physical access to like a Raspberry Pi or even a smartphone) or you host it on a VPS (= Virtual Private Server), which is basically a small, cheap server that runs 24/7. Both have advantages and disadvantages: - When you host the bot on a local device, it\'s way easier to setup the bot and get running quickly, yet you have to keep that device powered on all the time, which might be undesirable. - A cheap VPS will cost you a few bucks monthly and you have to use SSH to connect to it and set it up, but it will be powered on 24/7 and will usually be a better overall solution for such a bot.   == 3a) HOSTING THE BOT ON A LOCAL DEVICE == To run the bot on a local device, you need to have Python installed and install the necessary modules for Python. You can download the newest version of Python here: https://www.python.org/. Make sure to let the installer include Python in $PATH. Now install the modules. You can do that on Windows by navigating into the folder where this text document is, pressing Shift + Right click anywhere in the folder, clicking ""Open in PowerShell"" and running this command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt The steps should be very similar on Linux and macOS. If it says something along the lines of ""\'python\' not found"", try it with python3 instead or without ""python -m"" entirely and if it still doesn\'t work, your Python installation might be screwed up. Try reinstalling Python. To run your bot, just run ""python main.py"" (without quotation marks); ""python3"" instead of ""python"" might work too. If you get a message that looks like ""python: can\'t open file \'main.py\': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"", you\'re probably not in the right folder with your command prompt.   == 3b) HOSTING THE BOT ON A VPS == The process of hosting your bot on a VPS is more complicated and will inevitably require you to do most of the research on your own, but I can boil it down to the following steps (considering that your VPS runs some Linux distribution like Debian or CentOS - if it runs Windows, install a Linux distribution). In general: - First of all, get the VPS up and running and establish a connection to it via SSH* (native on Linux and Mac, use PuTTY on Windows for that) on your machine. - Transfer the whole folder with the bot over to the VPS over e.g. SFTP (you could use FileZilla for that and don\'t use normal FTP, it\'s not secure). - Configure the VPS to your needs (like installing Python and other needed programs and libraries). - Get a supervisor running (you could use supervisord for that) and let it take care of running your bot. - Take security measures like closing unneeded ports, using keyfiles for SSH, not allowing root connections with SSH etc. - Think of a good backup strategy, in case something happens to the valuable data on your VPS. If you\'re using a VPS, it\'s very easy to screw something up (like not properly securing the SSH connection with keyfiles), so please do *A LOT* of research on how to run and maintain a VPS, otherwise you might end up having your database leaked or something similar. If you have further questions about hosting a Discord bot, just hit me up, I\'ll be glad to help. But I will not host your bot. * SSH = Secure Shell, a way to securely build up a remote connection to a server and use the command line in it, also includes SFTP for file transfer   == 4) VPS CHOICE == The discord.py community recommends the following VPS providers: - https://scaleway.com/ - Incredibly cheap but powerful VPSes, owned by https://online.net/, based in Europe. - https://digitalocean.com/ - US-based cheap VPSes. The gold standard. Locations available world wide. - https://ovh.co.uk/ - Cheap VPSes, used by many people. France and Canadian locations available. - https://time4vps.eu/ - Cheap VPSes, seemingly based in Lithuania. - https://linode.com/ - More cheap VPSes! - https://vultr.com/ - US-based, DigitalOcean-like. - https://galaxygate.net/ - A reliable, affordable, and trusted host, Used by Dank Memer, Rythm, and many other people. Using one of the cheaper options is usually a good start and will do just fine for small bots (up to a around hundred servers) and most providers will give you a way to smoothly upgrade your current plan. But it of course also depends on what your bot can do: Does it save a lot (= many gigabytes) data, is it usually in many voice channels, does it do image/video manipulation a lot? But there are lots of other providers, just do a Google search and you\'ll be sure to find the right one. Be wary of free hosting providers like Heraku, those services are not made to host Discord bots and you\'ll run into issues when trying to do so (believe me, I\'ve fallen for them myself). If you have a spare Raspberry Pi, you can theoretically use it, but it will have subpar performance (especially if it\'s older or weaker than the Raspberry Pi 3B+).   That\'s about it, hopefully this helped you. If there\'s something wrong with your bot or something\'s not working, contact me. - Mikael.",python,3

Do your best and be creative.  If you need help ask sooner rather than later in slack. Myself and your classmates are here to help and do not wait to the last minute to do this assignment. ** You may work in two person teams, if you plan to do so please email me to let me know who you are working with. You may NOT work in multiple teams. ** You may use python, JAVA or node.js (javascript) for this assignment. ** I have listed some tutorials below, but you may need to google some on your own.    What You Will Do: You will create a RESTful web service that runs in a docker container. Your web service will contain two GET routes: One that displays a collection of records One that displays a single record that the corresponds to an ID Example: If I created two routes, /customers and /customers/35 (note, that 35 is the ID of a given customer in my database) The data returned from your web service routes must be in JSON or XML form. Note, if you would like to load your results in a web page you are welcome to do so, you just need a way to display the data your routes return in a web browser. You will create a hardcoded JSON file based database as the backing datastore for your web service routes. Note, if you are comfortable using a SQL or NO-SQL database as your datastore you may do so but it is not required. Also note, your data model is something you make up. Meaning you can store a collection of cars, customers, food items, restaurants, video games, sports teams etc. Be creative :) This is similar to what the presenter did in the GraphQL video we watched in our last class. He used a JSON file as a database for his demo. You will have to present your work to the class, with a live demo or video you recorded of you running your web service from own computer.

ERP software integrates all facets of an operation — including product planning, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing — in a single database, application and user interface. ERP is an Enterprise Application for ERP packages ERP software is considered to be a type of enterprise packages, that is software designed to be used by larger businesses and often requires dedicated teams to customize and analyze the data and to handle upgrades and deployment. In contrast, Small business ERP applications are lightweight business management software solutions, often customized for a specific business industry or vertical.  ERP Software Modules Explained ERP software typically consists of multiple enterprise Automobiles modules that are individually purchased, based on what best meets the specific needs and technical capabilities of the organization. Each ERP module is focused on one area of business processes, such as product development or marketing. Some of the most common ERP modules include those for product planning, material purchasing, inventory control, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance and HR. A business will typically use a combination of different modules to manage back-office activities and tasks including the following: Distribution process management, supply chain management, services knowledge base, configure, prices, improve accuracy of financial data, facilitate better project planning, automate employee life-cycle, standardize critical business procedures, reduce redundant tasks, assess business needs, accounting and financial applications, lower purchasing costs, manage human resources and payroll. As the ERP methodology has become more popular, ERP Customized software  have merged to help business managers implement ERP in to other business activities and may incorporate modules for CRM and business demo in kolkata, presenting it as a single ERP package. Recommended Reading: The Difference Between CRM and ERP The basic goal of using an enterprise resource planning system is to provide one central repository for all information that is shared by all the various ERP facets to improve the flow of data across the organization. Enterprise ERP Trends The ERP field can be slow to change, but the last couple of years have unleashed forces which are fundamentally shifting the entire area. The following new and continuing trends affect enterprise ERP software: 1. Mobile ERP  Executives and employees want real-time access to information, regardless of where they are. It is expected that businesses will embrace mobile ERP for the reports, dashboards and to conduct key business processes. 2. Cloud ERP The cloud has been advancing steadily into the enterprise for some time, but many ERP users have been reluctant to place data cloud. Those reservations have gradually been evaporating, however, as the advantages of the cloud become apparent. 3. Social ERP There has been much hype around social media and how important —or not — it is to add to ERP systems. Certainly, vendors have been quick to seize the initiative, adding social media packages to their ERP systems with much fanfare. But some wonder if there is really much gain to be had by integrating social media with ERP. 4. Two-tier ERP Enterprises once attempted to build an all-encompassing ERP system to take care of every aspect of organizational systems. But some expensive failures have gradually brought about a change in strategy – adopting two tiers of ERP. ERP Vendors Depending on your organization's size and needs there are a number of enterprise resource planning software vendors to choose from in the large enterprise, mid-market and the small business ERP market. Gartner's annual market share reports put SAP, Oracle, Sage, Microsoft and Net Suite among the top vendors, but vERP data suggests that SAP and Oracle are easily the biggest two, with vERP. http://www.verp.in/ERP-Packages""}",,2
152,https://github.com/niquewill/Consumer_Complaint.git,"{""Overview There are quite a few apps in the market that provide a public forum for bringing up complaints so they can get resolved. With these apps, customers could easily submit their complaints to companies via them and deliver them to the company's' Twitter account, e-mail, or Facebook accounts.  For the receiving companies, there are limited apps in the market that would help them to track these complaints, and store vital statistics such as receipt time, response time and trends. Typically, for a CEO, the behavior of the customers established by robust data and ability to relate company’s response to trends in the customer's’ behavior provide effective ways to evaluate customer’s satisfaction. The problem that this project seeks to solve is to provide organizations with a tool to log the complaints they receive and the company’s response mechanism. The database created will assist the company in generating data for future consumer behavioral analysis. Goals The Consumer Complaint app will enable organizations staff to log complaints from customers as ticket items and close the tickets from the complaint's inventory.  The app should also be able to track response time, volume of complaint across the company’s departments (product & services), regional trend and then provide a summary of the highest-frequency departments and regions of the company.  Specifications The app would be tested for financial institutions. Example input could be drawn from the website of the consumer financial protection bureau (CFPB) : Consumer Complaint Data  Milestones Database Create a MySQL Database (and a table inside database) to log complain ID, Product & Services, Department and Time of complaint.   Create a Mongo DB (NoSQL) to scrape part of the complaint from the CFPB website and display it on the browser. Backend Node.js Create a node application which will display all of the complaints that are logged  Whenever the bank administrator submits (logs in a complaint), the app will display “new complaint logged” on one side of the page: waiting to be closed.  Each ticket in the unclosed bucket would have a “close” button. Once the ticket is closed, the administrator will click it and the app will move it to the closed bucket and refresh the number of tickets unattended to.   A table would be created for the supervisor or department manager to view the Response Receipt Date/ Time, Number of Complaints per day, Category of Complaint (Product & Services), Response Closing Date and Time.  Frontend Materialize Create a stylish UI using Materialize CSS. Make the app to be mobile responsive. Themes examples: Starter.

155,https://github.com/harshita360/Covid19-Final.git,"CovidApp-by eYRC#1804 -An attempt to connect the frontline warrior to people at root level  PROBLEM ADDRESSED: Several studies show that India’s testing strategy lacks in many ways which may increase the number of COVID-19 patients enormously. The main problem that we have addressed in our idea is that India is not doing enough testing that could help it trace and treat infected patients and contain the spread of the disease. It also involves finding a solution of the human tendency not to reveal their symptoms which is a critical issue. In this solution, we have tried to fight against the disease at a community level involving the local police, the private doctors and the people.  DESCRIPTION: Our solution to the above problem is a native mobile application which mainly uses Firebase for backend services. The application consists of two broad sections that is people and the police of a particular area. Our aim is to make full use of the people in the medical field to ensure more and more testing. Thus, in our application we identify the available private hospitals for checking common symptoms of covid-19 who in turn will suggest them for immediate testing or a period of self-quarantine. This has been done by using Google Map API services. People who experience symptoms can simply login to the application, connect to a private hospital providing their basic information and we connect them to the nearest doctors. The app uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync this information which can later be analyzed. The app also includes a separate section where people of a community connect to the police of the area to inform them about a suspected case or any kind of problem (e.g. Crowding) the community faces. To eliminate false information, we use Firebase Authentication feature for the informants. To encourage the participations of more people in medical field to participate in this fight, we also have a local chat messaging feature through which people who login can talk to specified consultants for information and procced for further decisions of a checkup.  HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT: Since it is an application for android, there is no such hardware requirement. For user, they need an android based mobile device (version 4.0 and above). And for government, they need an infrastructure to felicitate the flow to data.  PROCESS FLOW: Currently, on our main screen there is an option for login as police or login as citizen. This is only for demonstration purpose. This could be two app, one only for citizens where they can register their complains and chat a medical representative and the second app will be for police where they could login through their login ID and see the complains of their area.  """"""""""""""""""Police Login can only be logged in by using some authenticated police id and name for now we have used 10 dummy police id to just show the process of authentication...

On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders\xa0completed\xa0most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user’s PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user’s choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is “Add to wishlist” button that can be used, and they are stored in user’s personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:  \xa0 \xa0‘multipliers’ => [ ‘product_delivered’ => 10, ‘product_dispute_lost’ =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_star’ => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_usd’ => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece …). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product’s quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin’s decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography\xa0(like\xa0XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF)\xa0to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user’s password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B’s public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don’t need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index – Basic information  Categories – Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages – Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users – View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products – View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log – Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage – Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes – View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets – View and resolve support tickets  Purchases – List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases – List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin – Included in standard version  Monero – Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included. These are not 100% copy paste but they do explain how must of the things work in detail.  Selling terms and conditions:  I’m selling only script, I won’t help you install it,or whatever you want to do after you purchase it  I’m not responsible for anything you do with the files after the purchase  After purchase you cannot resell or share this script  Script is tested for bugs but In case you find any, or any error in code it will be fixed with no additional charge  I will not give you files first in any case. I don’t care who you are, if you don’t trust me we will use escrow  In case of escrow I will deal only with bitcointalk trusted escrow (You can find list\xa0here)  Price stated below is for one copy of the script, that means I intend to sell it multiple times. In case you want to be the only buyer please contact me  DEMO LINK  Current price is:\xa0599$\xa0in BTC equivalent\xa0(please note that this can be changed at any time) For this price, you get standard version of the marketplace with two coins (Bitcoin and Monero). If you want additional coins, they are charged separately. Litecoin, DASH, PIVX are 50$ each, Verge is 60$ and Bitcoin Cash is 90$",,2

CC leverages its distinctive services to cloud customers in a very pay-as-you-go, anytime and anyplace manner. As well as Cloud services offer dynamically scalable services on demand. Therefore, service supplying plays a key role in CC. Then, it is good opportunity for customers to find suitable and lowly cost service for their project. Specially, Customer must be able to select appropriate cloud service according to their needs and money. It is time-consuming task for consumers to collect the necessary information and analyze from all cloud service providers to make right decision. As well as it is also a highly demanding task from a computational perspective because multiple consumers who have similar requirements conduct same computations repeatedly. They provide all products you might need for moving your business to the cloud. But these product offerings differ in pricing as well as the naming of their services. Some Businessmen already may use on-premises infrastructure or think which infrastructure will use for my project. They may have more complex problems like how to choose a cloud service, which services want use and specially how many costs want to pay for monthly or yearly. Sometimes, someone already use a cloud services, they have lot of problems like more expensive, less flexibility, hard to use, overwhelming options of services, poor management of GUI and tool, complex price schema and other issues. However, they must spend more price and time as useless. Because they could not select best cloud service provider early to their business. For solving the cloud service selection problem, many researchers have proposed some approaches including multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and Brokerage-Based Approach. But we cannot see any machine learning prediction system for solving this issue. This system enables the user to choose from among a number of available choices. In this paper, we make a neural network with TensorFlow to service selection in CC. This system focuses on three main players in CC. There are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform in the race for cloud services providers. I identify and synthesize several products relevant for web services in Cloud providers. There are Featured, Compute, Storage, Database, Networking, Operation, Identity & Access and Cost. As well as I focus on Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Because these are most aggressive segment in cloud service. It is less-complex IT needs, fewer legacy applications and less IT support than larger enterprises. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). We develop efficient and flexible recommendation system for ranking cloud service providers.

The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is a modern object-oriented programming language developed in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg, the principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft. It is pronounced as ""C-Sharp,"" inspired by the musical notation “♯” which stands for a note with a slightly higher pitch. As it’s considered an incremental compilation of the C++ language, the name C “sharp” seemed most appropriate. The sharp symbol, however, has been replaced by the keyboard friendly “#” as a suffix to “C” for purposes of programming.  Although the code is very similar to C++, C# is newer and has grown fast with extensive support from Microsoft. The fact that it’s so similar to Java syntactically helps explain why it has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages today.   C# is pronounced ""C-Sharp"".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  An Introduction to C# Programming  C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is structured and easy to learn. It runs on Microsoft’s .Net Framework and can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms. As the syntax is simple and easy to learn, developers familiar with C, C++, or Java have found a comfort zone within C#.  C# is a boon for developers who want to build a wide range of applications on the .NET Framework—Windows applications, Web applications, and Web services—in addition to building mobile apps, Windows Store apps, and enterprise software. It is thus considered a powerful programming language and features in every developer’s cache of tools.  Although first released in 2002, when it was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0, the C# language has evolved a great deal since then. The most recent version is C# 8.0, available in preview as part of Visual Studio. To get access to all of the new language features, you would need to install the latest preview version of .NET Core 3.0.   C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  Why Use C#?  It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It is easy to learn and simple to use It has a huge community support C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.   The C# Environment  You need the .NET Framework and an IDE (integrated development environment) to work with the C# language.  The .NET Framework  The .NET Framework platform of the Windows OS is required to write web and desktop-based applications using not only C# but also Visual Basic and Jscript, as the platform provides language interoperability. Besides, the .Net Framework allows C# to communicate with any of the other common languages, such as C++, Jscript, COBOL, and so on.   IDEs  Microsoft provides various IDEs for C# programming:  Visual Studio 2010 (VS) Visual Studio Express Visual Web Developer Visual Studio Code (VSC)  The C# source code files can be written using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compiled using the command-line compiler of the .NET Framework.   Alternative open-source versions of the .Net Framework can work on other operating systems as well. For instance, the Mono has a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Android, BSD, iOS, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX. This brings enhanced development tools to the developer.   As C# is part of the .Net Framework platform, it has access to its enormous library of codes and components, such as Common Language Runtime (CLR), the .Net Framework Class Library, Common Language Specification, Common Type System, Metadata and Assemblies, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and LINQ.   C# and Java  C# and Java are high-level programming languages that share several similarities (as well as many differences). They are both object-oriented languages much influenced by C++. But while C# is suitable for application development in the Microsoft ecosystem from the front, Java is considered best for client-side web applications. Also, while C# has many tools for programming, Java has a larger arsenal of tools to choose from in IDEs and Text Editors.   C# is used for virtual reality projects like games, mobile, and web applications. It is built specifically for Microsoft platforms and several non-Microsoft-based operating systems, like the Mono Project that works with Linux and OS X.  Java is used for creating messaging applications and developing web-based and enterprise-based applications in open-source ecosystems.  Both C# and Java support arrays. However, each language uses them differently. In C#, arrays are a specialization of the system; in Java, they are a direct specialization of the object.   The C# programming language executes on the CLR. The source code is interpreted into bytecode, which is further compiled by the CLR. Java runs on any platform with the assistance of JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The written source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into machine code to be executed on a JRE.   C# and C++   Although C# and C++ are both C-based languages with similar code, there are some differences. For one, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language, while C++ is a partial object-oriented language. Also, while both languages are compiled languages, C# compiles to CLR and is interpreted by.NET, but C++ compiles to machine code. The size of binaries in C# is much larger than in C++.  Other differences between the two include the following:  C# gives compiler errors and warnings, but C++ doesn’t support warnings, which may cause damage to the OS. C# runs in a virtual machine for automatic memory management. C++ requires you to manage memory manually. C# can create Windows, .NET, web, desktop, and mobile applications, but not stand-alone apps. C++ can create server-side, stand-alone, and console applications as it can work directly with the hardware. C++ can be used on any platform, while C# is targeted toward Windows OS. Generally, C++ being faster than C#, the former is preferred for applications where performance is essential.    Features of C#  The C# programming language has many features that make it more useful and unique when compared to other languages, including:   Object-oriented language Being object-oriented, C# allows the creation of modular applications and reusable codes, an advantage over C++. As an object-oriented language, C# makes development and maintenance easier when project size grows. It supports all three object-oriented features: data encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  Simplicity C# is a simple language with a structured approach to problem-solving. Unsafe operations, like direct memory manipulation, are not allowed.  Speed The compilation and execution time in C# is very powerful and fast.   A Modern programming language C# programming is used for building scalable and interoperable applications with support for modern features like automatic garbage collection, error handling, debugging, and robust security. It has built-in support for a web service to be invoked from any app running on any platform.  Type-safe Arrays and objects are zero base indexed and bound checked. There is an automatic checking of the overflow of types. The C# type safety instances support robust programming.  Interoperability Language interoperability of C# maximizes code reuse for the efficiency of the development process. C# programs can work upon almost anything as a program can call out any native API.  Consistency Its unified type system enables developers to extend the type system simply and easily for consistent behavior.  Updateable C# is automatically updateable. Its versioning support enables complex frameworks to be developed and evolved.  Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.   Prerequisites for Learning C#   Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.   Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#.   Advantages of C#   There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes  Familiar syntax  Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions   Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies   As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages  It’s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes  The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn’t hang it during execution  As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform  Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage   Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless  Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps  The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C#  Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework  C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework  Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement  What Can C Sharp Do for You?  C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   C# Programming for Beginners: Introduction, Features and Applications By Simplilearn Last updated on Jan 20, 2020674 C# Programming for Beginners As a programmer, you’re motivated to master the most popular languages that will give you an edge in your career.

Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.  Full Stack Java Developer Course The Gateway to Master Web DevelopmentEXPLORE COURSEFull Stack Java Developer Course Prerequisites for Learning C#  Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.  Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#. Advantages of C#  There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes Familiar syntax Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions  Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies  As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages It’s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn’t hang it during execution As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage  Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C# Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement What Can C Sharp Do for You? C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   Who Should Learn the C# Programming Language and Why?  C# is one of the most popular programming languages as it can be used for a variety of applications: mobile apps, game development, and enterprise software. What’s more, the C# 8.0 version is packed with several new features and enhancements to the C# language that can change the way developers write their C# code. The most important new features available are ‘null reference types,’ enhanced ‘pattern matching,’ and ‘async streams’ that help you to write more reliable and readable code.

257,https://github.com/IntecsSPA/toolboxenvironment.git,"The TOOLBOX has been initially developed under the SSE project and then upgraded within the GENESIS.  SSE integrates service providers (having variety of component models or middle-ware suited for their different platforms or environments) through XML, i.e. using SOAP and WSDL transported over a variety of transport mechanisms, i.e. IP, HTTP, and HTTPS. Thus, any service to be integrated within the SSE infrastructure must expose a SOAP interface (described by a WSDL file) according to the SSE Interface Control Document (SSE ICD). The TOOLBOX helps the service provider to convert its service in a SOAP based service compliant with the SSE ICD.  The GENESIS FP7 Integrated Project has been launched by DG INFSO in September 2008. The duration of the project is 3 years. The GENESIS consortium comprehends the 33 partners involved in the project ; the Coordinator of the project is Thales Alenia Space France. The GENESIS Consortium brings a wide panel of multidisciplinary skills and experiences :  participants skilled and experienced in ICT and related domains are key actors to define a reference collaborative architecture, and to make an efficient and sustainable solution; participants skilled and experienced in environmental domains as well as in health issues are key actors for the identification of users requirements, definition and implementation of the pilots, evaluation and take-up of the solution. Relying on standards and harmonization processes, GENESIS will provide a thematic-independant innovative solution : made of a generic software package. It is used as an ""information system set-up framework"", which provides the interoperability layer to existing information systems, so that they can access to environmental databases or services available at regional, national or European levels. The proposed solution, highly flexible and scalable, can be easily instantiated and customized to various thematic fields and various contexts all over Europe. The GENESIS framework is based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), where software components are grouped in classes of services; each class providing a particular type of function.  From the W3C specification:  SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. The Toolbox is composed by two application, a development environment and a run-time environment  The run-time environment is a web application which allows the deployment of generic and OGC compliant Web Services by means of some XML scripts which describe the operations that have to be done when the service is invoked The development environment is an Eclipse plugin which provides some tools to easily creates the TOOLBOX services , editing its script files and resources and automatic deploy the services in the run-time environment. The run-time and development environment can be used separately. The XML scripts can be created with any tool supporting XML or with a text editor (the scripts have to be compliant to the XMLScript Schema). HMA OGC",,1

A site has the attributes name, role, URI, and a list of zero or more access points (addresses), whereas an access point has the attributes label and URL. All the attributes are strings. Sites are identified by their name, while the access points of a site are identified by their label. Different sites may contain access points with the same label. Your API should support CRUD operations on the access points of a site, as well as on the sites. CRUD operations on a site affect its attributes but not its list of access points, with the exception of a delete which cascades to deleting all its access points. You should persist the resources in a plain text local file of json objects. Using a database system to persist the resources is optional. Use a RESTful client to test your API. Using a json-extension in your web browser and a CLI tool (eg curl or wget) may facilitate the rapid development of a client for testing.",,1

One of the key points at the start was in 1971, where Ray Tomlinson sent the very first email and his technology set the platform to allow people to send and receive files through different machines.[10] However, the more recognizable period as being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where the Archie search engine was created as an index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of computers was already big enough to store huge volumes of customer information. Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing, rather than a limited list broker.[11] These kinds of databases allowed companies to track customers\' information more effectively, thus transforming the relationship between buyer and seller. However, the manual process was not as efficient.  In the 1990s, the term Digital Marketing was first coined,.[12] With the debut of server/client architecture and the popularity of personal computers, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications became a significant factor in marketing technology.[citation needed] Fierce competition forced vendors to include more service into their software, for example, marketing, sales and service applications. Marketers were also able to own huge online customer data by eCRM software after the Internet was born. Companies could update the data of customer needs and obtain the priorities of their experience. This led to the first clickable banner ad being going live in 1994, which was the ""You Will"" campaign by AT&T and over the first four months of it going live, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad.

The Web applications focusing on ASP.NET Framework 4.6 run just on the Windows stage. The Web applications focusing on the ASP.NET Core can keep running on Windows and non-Windows stages. Obviously, as on this composition, ASP.NET Core doesn\'t offer the same rich usefulness offered by ASP.NET Framework 4.6.  2. Part of Project.json  ASP.NET Core utilizes an exceptional document—Project.json for putting away all the undertaking level configuration data. Project.config can store numerous design settings, for example, references to NuGet bundles utilized as a part of the task and target structures.  ""dependencies"": {    ""Microsoft.AspNet.IISPlatformHandler"": ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel"": ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc"": ""6.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.TagHelpers"": ""6.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.StaticFiles"": ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.Tooling.Razor"": ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions"":       ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json"":       ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""EntityFramework.MicrosoftSqlServer"": ""7.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""EntityFramework.Commands"": ""7.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Microsoft.AspNet.Session"": ""1.0.0-rc1-final"",    ""Newtonsoft.Json"": ""8.0.3""  The Project.json record stores configuration data in JSON position. The above markup demonstrates a conditions segment that contains a rundown of NuGet bundles required by the application. For instance, the Web application under thought requires the 6.0.0-rc1-last form of Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc get together, etc  3. Part of AppSettings.json  ASP.NET stores application configuration settings in Web.config. For instance, engineers utilize the <appSettings> area to store custom application settings, the <connectionStrings> segment to store database association strings, etc. ASP.NET Core utilizes AppSettings.json to store such bits of data.  Consider the accompanying configuration:  {    ""AppSettings"": {       ""Title"": ""My ASP.NET Core Application""    },      ""Data"": {       ""DefaultConnection"": {          ""ConnectionString"": ""data source=.;             initial catalog=Northwind;integrated security=true""       }    } }  The previous JSON markup comprises of two properties or keys, to be specific AppSettings and Data. The AppSettings property holds a sub-key named Title. The Title sub-key has a string estimation of ""My ASP.NET Core Application"". Also, the Data key has a DefaultConnection sub-key. The DefaultConnection thusly has a ConnectionString sub-key.  4. Application set-up  In ASP.NET, Global.asax goes about as the passage point for your application. You can wire different events handlers for occasions, for example, Application_Start and Session_Start, in the Global.asax record. In ASP.NET Core, the application startup happens in an unexpected way—it happens through a Startup class.  one such Startup class -   public class Startup {    public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env,       IApplicationEnvironment app)    {       ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();       builder.SetBasePath(app.ApplicationBasePath);       builder.AddJsonFile(""appsettings.json"");       IConfigurationRoot config = builder.Build();       string str = config.Get<string>          (""Data:DefaultConnection:ConnectionString"");       // do something with str    }      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)       {          services.AddMvc();          services.AddEntityFramework()                  .AddSqlServer();    }      public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)    {       app.UseStaticFiles();       app.UseMvc(routes =>       {          routes.MapRoute(             name: ""default"",             template: ""{controller=Home}/                {action=Index}/{id?}"");          });       }      public static void Main(string[] args) =>       WebApplication.Run<Startup>(args); }    The Startup class appeared above starts with a constructor. The constructor stacks the AppSettings.json record utilizing ConfigurationBuilder class. The Get() strategy then is utilized to peruse the database association string put away in the AppSettings.json document.      The ConfigureServices() technique includes the administrations required by the application. For instance, here you add MVC and Entity Framework to the administrations gathering.   The Configure() technique determines and arranges the administrations included before for application\'s utilization. For instance, the MVC directing is designed in the code appeared previously.    5. Tag Helpers  In ASP.NET MVC 5, you utilized HTML assistants, for example, BeginForm(), LabelFor(), and TextBoxFor() to render structures and frame fields. You can keep on using HTML partners in ASP.NET Core, too. However, there is a superior option: Tag Helpers. Label aides take the type of standard HTML labels with certain extraordinary asp-* credits added to them.  Consider the accompanying markup that renders a structure: <form asp-controller=""Home"" asp-action=""Save"" method=""post"">    <table border=""1"" cellpadding=""10"">       <tr>           <td><label asp-for=""FirstName"">First Name :</label></td>           <td><input type=""text"" asp-for=""FirstName"" /></td>       </tr>       <tr>           <td><label asp-for=""LastName"">Last Name :</label></td>           <td><input type=""text"" asp-for=""LastName"" /></td>       </tr>       <tr>           <td><label asp-for=""Email"">Email :</label></td>           <td><input type=""text"" asp-for=""Email"" /></td>       </tr>       <tr>           <td><label asp-for=""Phone"">Phone :</label></td>           <td><input type=""text"" asp-for=""Phone"" /></td>       </tr>         <tr>           <td colspan=""2"">              <input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" />           </td>       </tr>    </table> </form>   Observe clearly, the properties that start with asp-. They are characterized by the label aides. For instance, the structure label aide utilizes asp-controller ascribe to indicate the objective controller name and asp-activity credit to determine the objective activity technique name. Correspondingly, asp-for traits utilized with name and info label partners tie a name or a text box to a model property. Label partners are more advantageous to use than HTML assistants in light of the fact that their linguistic structure nearly takes after the HTML markup.  6. View Components  In MVC 5, you utilized halfway perspectives as a way to reuse markup and code. ASP.NET Core presents View Components, the more intense and adaptable option. A perspective part comprises of a class normally acquired from ViewComponent base class and a perspective record containing the required markup. This programming model is entirely like the one utilized by controllers and perspectives. It permits you to separate code and markup from each other—code in the perspective segment class and markup in a perspective. Once made, you can utilize a perspective segment on a perspective by utilizing the @Component.Invoke() technique.  7. Dependency Injection  ASP.NET Core gives an inbuilt reliance infusion system. The DI system of ASP.NET Core offers four-lifetime modes for a sort being infused: Singleton: An object of an administration (the sort to be infused) is made and supplied to all the requests to that administration. Along these lines, fundamentally all requests get the same article to work with.  Scoped: An object of an administration is made for every single request. In this way, every request gets another event of an administration to work with.   Transient: An object of an administration is made each time an article is asked.   Instance: For this situation, you are in charge of making an object of an administration. The DI system then uses that case in singleton mode said prior  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {    services.AddMvc();    services.AddSingleton<IMyService,MyService>(); }  Here, MyService is the sort to be enlisted with the DI structure and actualizes IMyService. The AddSingleton() technique enlists this type for Singleton mode portrayed previously. Once a sort is enrolled with the DI system, you can infuse it in a controller like this:  public class HomeController : Controller {    private IMyService obj;      public HomeController(IMyService obj)    {       this.obj = obj;    }    ....    .... }  8. Gulp, Grunt, and Bower Support   Gulp and Grunt are JavaScript assignment runners. They help you computerize generally required undertakings, for example, packaging JavaScript and CSS records, minifying JavaScript and CSS documents, and arranging Less and Sass records (and some more). They are introduced utilizing npm (Node Package Manager). The ASP.NET Core venture made utilizing Visual Studio 2015 permits you to include Grunt and Gulp arrangement documents furthermore gives Task Runner Explorer to screen the errands.  Bower is a bundle administrator basically for front-end bundles. Front-end bundles are the bundles that you use in your Web pages, for example, JavaScript libraries/systems and CSS records. For instance, you may introduce jQuery in your ASP.NET Core venture by utilizing Bower. An ASP.NET Core venture made utilizing Visual Studio 2015 permits you to include a Bower setup document. You likewise can work with the bundles utilizing the Manage Bower Packages menu choice.  9. Single Programming for Web API Model for and MVC  In MVC 5, controllers acquire from the System.Web.Mvc.Controller base class. What\'s more, Web API 2 controllers acquire from System.Web.Http.ApiController. In ASP.NET Core, both of these structures are converged into a solitary system. Therefore, under ASP.NET Core, an MVC controller and Web API controller both acquire from Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Controller base class. You then can design viewpoints, for example, HTTP verb mapping and the directing of the controllers as coveted.  10. Static Files and the wwwroot Folder   In ASP.NET, there is no settled area for putting away static documents, for example, picture records, JavaScript documents, and CSS records (engineers regularly utilized a Content envelope to store such documents). In ASP.NET Core, all the static records are kept under the wwwroot envelope (default). You likewise can change the name of this envelope by utilizing the Project.json document.  Refer the figure following down -    After arrangement, the wwwroot turns into the Web application\'s root. Every one of the URLs to static records are determined as for this envelope. Along these lines,/pictures/logo.png anticipates that logo.png will be available under the wwwroot/pictures envelope.  Conclusion -   ASP.NET Core 1.0 is a redone system outfitted towards present day cloud based, measured Web applications. Despite the fact that the new structure safeguards the key ideas of MVC 5, ASP.NET engineers will discover numerous contrasts between MVC 5 and ASP.NET Core 1.0. This article specified the imperative new components/ideas that you have to comprehend to start your voyage with ASP.NET Core 1.0.",,1

271,https://github.com/kavithareddygade/springboothoover.git,"Introduction  You will write a service that navigates a imaginary robotic hoover (much like a Roomba) through an equally imaginary room based on:  room dimensions as X and Y coordinates, identifying the top right corner of the room rectangle. This room is divided up in a grid based on these dimensions; a room that has dimensions X: 5 and Y: 5 has 5 columns and 5 rows, so 25 possible hoover positions. The bottom left corner is the point of origin for our coordinate system, so as the room contains all coordinates its bottom left corner is defined by X: 0 and Y: 0. locations of patches of dirt, also defined by X and Y coordinates identifying the bottom left corner of those grid positions. an initial hoover position (X and Y coordinates like patches of dirt) driving instructions (as cardinal directions where e.g. N and E mean ""go north"" and ""go east"" respectively) The room will be rectangular, has no obstacles (except the room walls), no doors and all locations in the room will be clean (hoovering has no effect) except for the locations of the patches of dirt presented in the program input.  Placing the hoover on a patch of dirt (""hoovering"") removes the patch of dirt so that patch is then clean for the remainder of the program run. The hoover is always on - there is no need to enable it.  Driving into a wall has no effect (the robot skids in place).  Goal  The goal of the service is to take the room dimensions, the locations of the dirt patches, the hoover location and the driving instructions as input and to then output the following:  The final hoover position (X, Y) The number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up Input  Program input will be received in a json payload with the format described here.

Pay-sa is a mobile commerce platform, offering its customers a digital wallet to store money and make quick payments. It requires users to create password protected accounts; that store information such as their name, mobile number, E-mail address, wallet balance, bank account details and net banking details; in order to carry out day to day transactions in a safe and convenient environment. The program stores a database of all its customers which contains all information stored by each account, with the application of file handling. The customer can edit most of this information, barring some invariable details, at any point in time. Due to lack of connectivity to the actual bank database at the current stage, the program creates a virtual bank database which requires the user to input his/her bank balance manually. The bank balance of the registered customers can be monitored and updated by a bank employee by logging in with the unique Bank User ID ( currently set as “bank1234” ) and password ( currently set as “1234bank” ). The customers can transfer money from their bank account to their digital wallet and vice-versa or from their digital wallet to any other customer’s digital wallet or bank account. Payments can be made conveniently using this program by transferring money from one person’s digital wallet to the intended recipient’s digital wallet or bank account, provided both the sender and the recipient are Pay-sa account holders. In addition to providing a platform for easy payment, Pay-sa also allows its users to request money/payment from other users by sending request messages. The program also stores a list of transactions made in the past ( up to a certain maximum limit ) by the customer, for future reference, in the form of a passbook. Each passbook entry includes the amount transferred and the details of the recipient ( name, mobile number, etc. ).

Currently, there are more than 465 million patients worldwide suffering from this disease, majority of which fall under the type 2 diabetic status. India can be labelled the diabetic capital of the world with the second largest population of diabetic patients. Diabetes has a very high mortality rate due to the fact that majority of the patients do not get their diagnosis in time. In fact, one of two diabetes patients realize the status of their disease a little too late. This delay in diagnosis can be caused by one or more of the factors such as lack of information about the disease, cumbersome and time-consuming diagnosis procedure, lack of funds for diagnosis and low reliability of some doctors. With this project, the aim is to build a web application that can provide end-to-end service for such patients. This application ensures high accuracy of prediction, is free of charge and easily accessible over the internet at all times. Diabetex application will not only predict whether a patient has diabetes, but also give them a detailed report of the diagnosis, educate them about diabetes, help them get in touch with doctors for treatment, give feedback about the application etc. The backend of the application is built on the UCI’s PIDD (Pima Indian Diabetes Database) and uses Python, SQL, PHP, Flask and HTML5 as its base technology. The classifier is a special two-level system where various classifiers at level one is assigned weightage and fed into the ensemble classifier at level two to increase accuracy and mimic real-life diagnosis environment. This system is compared to various other approaches for novelty and better results.",,1
277,https://github.com/preethi-muthukumaran/HelpingHands.git,"{""## Inspiration Forever in history books to come, COVID-19 will mark the year of 2020. The incredibly destructive pandemic made entire social and economic structures crumble. With social distancing in most of the world, communities and personal feelings of connection felt lost. Under quarantine orders, the already overworked middle class was unable to work. Amidst all the chaos, particular groups of individuals face higher risks and stakes associated with a potential contraction of COVID-19 and thus must take extra precautions to limit exposure. Among these groups include adults 65 and older, individuals with respiratory diseases, those with diabetes, and more.  ## What it does Our project aims to match volunteers with people at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19 in order to fulfill basic services such as grocery delivery and tutoring.  ## How we built it Dividing up the project into three modules, each team member took a crash course in back-end microservices, database management, and front-end web development. We built APIs that when invoked with information from someone seeking help, would add their name to a database. Similarly, another API adds volunteer information to its respective database. By parsing the database, we matched up volunteers and individuals needing assistance based on criteria such as services requested/offered and location relative to each other and returned that list to the volunteer who may fulfill the request. ## Challenges we ran into The biggest challenge was the limited time in which we all had to learn our respective parts. Preethi (me), Aishwarya, and Raymond had to take a crash course on how to build and scale a web application, along with relevant coding in JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and working with neDB along the way. ## Accomplishments that we're proud of We are immensely proud to put together a minimum viable product in such a short period of time. It took a lot of fast-paced innovation, learning, and building. Additionally, our great communication skills allowed us to help each other and make sure that our project was on track for completion. Finally, our resolve to help our communities in this time of great need motivates us to continue working on this project in order well past the PlexHacks Hackathon. ## What we learned Along with our newfound full-stack technical skills and the ability to build/scale web applications, we improved our skills on adaptability. We understand that one of the most important qualities of a computer scientist and developer is the ability to learn on the job and get work done on a deadline. These were put to the test, along with our ability to openly communicate, and we managed to pull through.  ## What's next for Helping Hands As previously mentioned, our resolve to helping our communities, especially members whom are most vulnerable, will drive us to continue working on this project. Shortly, we hope to deploy and put this product to use. Finally, post-pandemic, we believe that this technology and application can be adapted to suit the needs of the ever-changing world by continually providing our community with the help it needs.

Table of Contents Copyright Eric Schanet 2015 made with the Documenter v2.0 (http://rxa.li/documenter) Start PRELIMINARIES FIRST STEPS CLASSES LOCALIZATION The project uses Parse (http://www.parse.com) as backend - a service that lets you host your data and essentially spares you of the whole server-side programmation, you don\'t need to write a single line of server-side code (PHP, etc.). This is a huge advantage, because you, as a developer, can completely focus on creating a wonderful user interface and experience, without having to think much about data modelling - you send your data to parse, and they store it for you. Fortunately, Parse has a great free plan, where you can store 20GB of files, 20GB of database and even transfer 1TB of data - for free! This means you have enough space for your users and don\'t need to host expensive servers. Additionally, Parse offers a Push Notification service (which is really cool for a social network). Concerning the login, we also make use of the Facebook SDK (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios), because we do not only offer a classic username/password login, but also a Facebook login via Facebook button. For the Messenger in our social network, we decided to use Firebase (http://www.firebase.com) alongside with Parse. Roughly, we store the messages on Firebase but the proper chatrooms on Parse. This has some very good reasons, it reduces the latency of the messenger and allows us to integrate read and delivered receipts.",,1

280,https://github.com/TARANPREETS1999/A-Time-Efficient-Approach-For-Detecting-Errors-In-Big-Sensor-Data-On-Cloud.git,"Big sensor data is prevalent in both industry and scientific research applications where the data is generated with high volume and velocity it is difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. Cloud computing provides a promising platform to support the addressing of this challenge as it provides a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable manner at low cost. Some techniques have been developed in recent years for processing sensor data on cloud, such as sensor-cloud. However, these techniques do not provide efficient support on fast detection and locating of errors in big sensor data sets. For fast data error detection in big sensor data sets, in this paper, we develop a novel data error detection approach which exploits the full computation potential of cloud platform and the network feature of WSN. Firstly, a set of sensor data error types are classified and defined. Based on that classification, the network feature of a clustered WSN is introduced and analyzed to support fast error detection and location. Specifically, in our proposed approach, the error detection is based on the scale-free network topology and most of detection operations can be conducted in limited temporal or spatial data blocks instead of a whole big data set. Hence the detection and location process can be dramatically accelerated. Furthermore, the detection and location tasks can be distributed to cloud platform to fully exploit the computation power and massive storage. Through the experiment on our cloud computing platform of U-Cloud, it is demonstrated that our proposed approach can significantly reduce the time for error detection and location in big data sets generated by large scale sensor network systems with acceptable error detecting accuracy.",,1

This application was initially designed to monitor our internal servers, after designing it, we started to use it to monitor more then just servers. The flat client admin GUI will allow you to create your own types to categorize the device that you wish to monitor. Since this application just pings the device DNS name or IP Address it didn’t matter if it was a server or not so it’s really more of a network Device Monitor. Why is this application free and open source considering everything else I find on the web is something you have to pay for just to ping a device.  Well since we did publish the source code, it is free for you to change and compile as you like.  We used Visual Studio 2005 for this application to start and Upgraded it to Visual Studio 2010 using .Net 4.0.  Eventually we will upgrade it to the latest Visual Studio version.

Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.  ## Instructions  Design the following database schema containing three tables:  ![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)  * **department**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name  * **role**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title   * **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary   * **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to  * **employee**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name   * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name   * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has   * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager    Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:    * Add departments, roles, employees    * View departments, roles, employees    * Update employee roles  Bonus points if you're able to:    * Update employee managers    * View employees by manager    * Delete departments, roles, and employees    * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department  We can frame this challenge as follows:  ``` As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company So that I can organize and plan my business ```  How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:  * Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.  * Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.  * Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.  * You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?  * You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.  ![Employee Tracker](Assets/employee-tracker.gif)  ### Hints  * You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.  * Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.  * Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.  * Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.  ## Minimum Requirements  * Functional application.  * GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.  * The command-line application should allow users to:    * Add departments, roles, employees    * View departments, roles, employees    * Update employee roles  ## Bonus  * The command-line application should allow users to:    * Update employee managers    * View employees by manager    * Delete departments, roles, and employees    * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department  ## Commit Early and Often  One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:  * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.  * Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.  Follow these guidelines for committing:  * Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.  * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.  * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).  * Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.  We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!   ## Submission on BCS  You are required to submit the following:  * The URL of the GitHub repository  * A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality   - - - © 2019 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

When doctors are able to use Internet of Things for research and peer-reviewed studies, they can perform better. Diseases can be cured and prevented with facts and remedies from around the world. Telemedicine technologies can be used to provide critical medical care to people in rural and remote areas.  Such digital advancements are taking the healthcare industry into the future. However, these opportunities come with a significant security risk. In order to improve the cardiac monitoring of a patient, a lot of new medical devices can be installed, but they bring along the risk of new entry points for cyber criminals. According to the 2017 KPMG/Forbes Insights Cyber-Security Survey, 55% organizations have seen an employee falling prey to phishing scam and 34%              have seen theft from secured database by internal bad actor.  Cyber and privacy breaches bring along the risk of loss of digital assets and also cause irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization. Patient data will always remain a critical asset in the healthcare industry. However, cyber criminals are in the want of stealing this protected health information (PHI). The value of medical data is ten times more than that of financial data in the black market of dark web. In the last two years, 47% of healthcare organizations have had a security breach related to HIPAA.  Sensor-based wireless devices have proven to be a boon as well as a bane for the healthcare industry. Wireless devices allow efficient communication and seamless patient management. But they also act as an entryway into the network of the hospital. For cyber criminals this is an easy way to access sensitive information from the hospital’s networks.  Continuous technology assessments are critical to cyber security. It is imperative that healthcare organizations address all the vulnerabilities before integrating new technologies. Awareness about the potential attacks is of utmost importance.  ACS Guaranty’s Cyber-Security Solutions assist critical infrastructure organizations altering their security and privacy controls into business-enabling platforms. ACS, a Guaranteed Secured Centre safeguards IT networks and secures critical data from any cyber-attack. The company covers all the needs from pre- to post-breach in terms of cyber security. Solutions include threat intelligence, cyber forensics, and other cyber risk services.  Most common methods of attack are malware (72%), ransomware (32%) and internal theft (47%). Sharing data with third parties is on the top of perceived vulnerabilities list with 63% organizations complaining about it. Other vulnerabilities on the list include internet devices not controlled by IT (59%), external attackers (50%), and employee breaches (27%). Hence, a balanced cyber security program is required.  Healthcare organizations must implement advanced cyber security solutions, and should train and aware their staff regularly about the potential risks. Organizations ignoring this risk are vulnerable to incalculable damage to their reputation as well as their finances. ",,1

287,https://github.com/sanusanth/C-basic-simple-program.git,"What is C++?  C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.  Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname ""Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages.""  C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.  C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.  The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.    About C++ Programming  Multi-paradigm Language - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.  General Purpose Language - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.  Speed - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.  Object-oriented - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.  Why Learn C++?  C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.  After learning C++, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.  C++ helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.  How to learn C++?  C++ tutorial from Programiz - We provide step by step C++ tutorials, examples, and references. Get started with C++.  Official C++ documentation - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C++ documentation.  Write a lot of C++ programming code- The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code.  Read C++ code- Join Github\'s open-source projects and read other people\'s code.  C++ best programming language?  The answer depends on perspective and requirements. Some tasks can be done in C++, though not very quickly. For example, designing GUI screens for applications.  Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them. Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.  Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.  C++ is still used widely, and the most famous software have their backbone in C++.  This tutorial will help you learn C++ basic and the advanced concepts.  Who uses C++?  Some of today\'s most visible used systems have their critical parts written in C++.  Examples are Amadeus (airline ticketing)  Bloomberg (financial formation), Amazon (Web commerce), Google (Web search) Facebook (social media)  Many programming languages depend on C++\'s performance and reliability in their implementation. Examples include:  Java Virtual Machines JavaScript interpreters (e.g., Google\'s V8) Browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla\'s Firefox, Apple\'s Safari, and Google\'s Chrome)  Application and Web frameworks (e.g., Microsoft\'s .NET Web services framework).  Applications that involve local and wide area networks, user interaction, numeric, graphics, and database access highly depend on C++ language.  Why Use C++  C++ is one of the world\'s most popular programming languages.  C++ can be found in today\'s operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.  C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.  C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.  C++ is fun and easy to learn!  As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa   Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean?  C++ is an object oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.  Some call C++ “C with classes” because it introduces object oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework.  C++ is pronounced ""see-plus-plus.""   C++ Variables  Variables are the backbone of any programming language.  A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a ""word"" that will describe this information.  Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were declared.   C++ Control Structures  When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as ""code flow.""  When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code.  You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.   C++ Syntax  The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols.  Well, it\'s because an email address has its well-defined syntax. You need some combination of letters, numbers, potentially with underscores (_) or periods (.) in between, followed by an at the rate (@) symbol, followed by some website domain (company.com).  So, syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of well-functioning software.  But, if you don\'t abide by the rules of a programming language or syntax, you\'ll get errors.  C++ Tools  In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object) that helps you to get a certain job done promptly.  Well, this holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming is some piece of software which when used with the code allows you to program faster.  There are probably tens of thousands, if not millions of different tools across all the programming languages.  Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view them.   Types of C++ Errors  Another way to look at C++ in a practical sense is to start enumerating different kinds of errors that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution.  First, there are syntax errors where the code is actually written in an illegible way. This can be a misuse of punctuation, or the misspelling of a function command or anything else that compromises the integrity of the syntax as it is written.  Another fundamental type of error is a compiler error that simply tells the programmer the compiler was not able to do its work effectively. As a compiler language, C++ relies on the compiler to make the source code into machine readable code and optimize it in various ways.  A third type of error happens after the program has been successfully compiled. Runtime errors are not uncommon in C++ executables. What they represent is some lack of designated resource or non-working command in the executable program.  In other words, the syntax is right, and the program was compiled successfully, but as the program is doing its work, it encounters a problem, whether that has to do with interdependencies, operating system requirements or anything else in the general environment in which the program is trying to work.  Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object oriented programming works.",,1

Once you are in the directory, you can run npm install and it will download all the dependencies you need for this manager to work. Now all you have to do is edit Configuration.js. Run the manager from terminal using the command node Boot. Party. Requirements Just execute npm install to install the dependencies all at once.  The only file you have to edit is Configuration.js, what you need to edit in there is the secret session key, it has to be something random and secure so get a password from the Strong Passwords section of: https://randomkeygen.com/  Edit these if you wish: https://imgur.com/a/J8ZGDx4 to specify if you want it available for everyone or for certain people. Per feature you edit, keep it as 0 if you DONT want the feature to appear at all, OR change it to 1 if you want the feature to appear to normal users (redemption and adding items), or to moderators (managing penguins and verifying usernames) OR set the feature to 2 if you want it to appear for administrators only, if it is set to 2, you must specify who is an administrator by adding their ID to the list here https://imgur.com/a/qfwlZQ0.  Register your recaptcha keys from google recaptcha (v3). Add your site and secret key here: https://imgur.com/a/JZ54E6V  When running this panel, you need your sub-domain to be reverse proxying off port 4444 so that you can visit your panel link directly, instead of having :3000 added at the end of it. So edit your nginx configuration, add this line proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;. Make sure the default placed line try_files $uri $uri/ =404; is removed. You can find a similar alternative for apache too. If you choose to not reverse proxy, you will have to visit the link via subdomain:3000 (adding :3000 on the end of the URL). This is not recommended, although is still possible. Make sure you keep your panel files away from your web-server, which means DON'T put them in /var/www/html or /var/www.  Using nodemailer and gmails service, you can have an option to reset your password without logging into the panel, for this to work you need a GMAIL account dedicated for the CPPS reset password links, this will be used to email the links, the details of the account will be specified in Configuration.js so that it's usable. Remember this feature is disabled by default so if you want to enable it, you need to set reset_password to 1 in Configuration.js  The reset password feature uses a table to keep track of reset password links expiry and usability, please insert this new table into your database (assuming you use Houdini) https://pastebin.com/KhdRsDLE. Then setup your GMAIL account, configure the username and password in Configuration.js and make sure you set the sub_domain field to the sub domain you are running the manager off i.e. manager.cpps.com. This is so that it can send the correct reset password link leading to i.e. manager.cpps.com/reset/unique_id.""}",,1

You should assign a Privacy Officer to examine each rule in its entirety.           HIPAA compliance 2018 rule ""requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information""           The majorities of us believe that our medical and different wellness data is individual and should be secured. We also believe we should know who has this information and worry about how safe it is. The Privacy Rule, a Federal law, provides you with rights around your quality of life data and models principles and limits on who can look at and obtain your Health information. As long as we ensure reasonable safeguards, 2018 changes to HIPAA compliance Privacy Rule and Security Rule allow appropriate electronically communication and handling of health care \'Protected Health Information\'. All personal medical information, including name, address, Social Security number, and all medical information about an ""individual"" come under PHI.  HIPAA 2018 Changes In this HIPAA session we will be discussing HIPAA 2018 Changes taking place in Washington with the Health and Human Services when it comes to the enforcement of the HIPAA regulations already on the books as well as some step-by-step discussions on the audit method and some current functions regarding HIPAA cases (both in courtrooms and from live audits).  Attend this Session            As a healthcare organization, you must still make sure that a few checks and steps are taken to ensure that HIPAA compliance 2018 changes are followed within the organization:   Administrative Safeguards:  Always have a documented physical security policies and procedures. Helps guide existing and new security personnel Have designated HIPAA compliance officers whenever and wherever possible Injunction instructions should be documented and followed against workforce members who fail to comply with the security policy Continuous security upgrading and reminders in the form of seminars, test and webinars conducted internally Appling procedures to documents information system activities, such as audit records, access reports and security-incident checking reports Ensure regular reviews of the audit trails, logs and system activity of the employees with access to ePHI Planning and timed reviewing of procedural contingency policy on accessing backups of ePHI, establishing continuous processing of critical business process for protection of ePHI Special business partners compliance contracts with partners who will have access to ePHI. Choose partners that have similar agreements with any of their partners to which they are also extending access HIPAA - Texting & Emailing in 2018 With the introduction of smartphones, emails have become the even more accessible form of communication. In conjunction with email comes the issue of security and them being intercepted and read by unintended persons. Precautions and steps are to be taken at every step of the way. So for a Healthcare concern or a business associate, it\'s a key to maximize patient communication tools while protecting itself and the organization from government penalties and patient lawsuits.  Attend this Session  Physical Safeguards:  Identifying and assigning personnel for developing and implementing security policies and procedures Disaster recovery plan and emergency plan, which is away from the normal operation facility. This ensures that the organization has a data backup plan established to create, maintain retrievable and restore exact copies of ePHI Employee workstation access and security - ensure proper password control, applications accessed and installed, and the physical attributes and the surroundings of the workstation that can access ePHI Following proper procedures for proper disposal of old/used hardware, proper reuse of the same All old hardware disposed should have data backed up from those disposed hardware Any paper trail of ePHI data is only accessible to selected employee and are always secured properly Implementing strong Bring-Your-Own-Device [BYOD] HIPAA Compliance policies in the organization where ePHI data is accessible and technology tools are integral to control the access to data outside the organization HIPAA Privacy Officer: Module 1 HIPAA Privacy Officer Training will uncover all HIPAA and HITECH expectations in protecting patient and member\'s right to privacy and the confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI) as you engage in treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO) services.  Attend this Session  Technical Safeguards:  Steps for creating changing and securing password management should be documented and implemented regularly Security measures to ensure integrity of the ePHI data that electronically transmitted - making sure they are not improperly modified without detection until discarded Securing digital ePHI data by encrypting them, at all/most times, by whenever means deemed appropriate Securing access control points by ensuring critical thought process is put into password protection, rules for accessing data, automatic log off from systems Audit controls implementing hardware, software and procedural restriction and procedures to record activities on information system that have healthcare data Under new HIPAA 2018 Compliance rule ensure proper steps to be taken by the organization when a patient has not agreed to receive ePHI in unencrypted email or unencrypted text message Ensure ePHI data that are at rest i.e. data that is kept in databases, servers, flash drives either by password protection or access to physical hardware is restricted and data is all/most time\'s encryption For all online forms that use or request or accept ePHI ensure the use of security measures, such as SSL and advanced password protections like 2FA In 2018 HIPAA Compliance Privacy rule make sure that anti-virus softwares are run and systematically updated on machines that have access to ePHI Current recommendation of using NIST-recommended AES 256-bit encryption standard for data transmissions through electronic devices HIPAA Privacy Officer: Module 2 HIPAA Privacy Officer Training will cover all ongoing activities of a Privacy Program related to the development, implementation, maintenance of, and adherence to the organization\'s policies and procedures covering the privacy of, and access to, patient health information in compliance with federal and state laws and the healthcare organization\'s information privacy practices.

291,https://github.com/itanand/Eccomerce-App-Website.git,"Project Proposal 🗓 I am planning on designing and implementing an e-Commerce shopping application in Android that will allow end-users to register, login to the app and browse for products in different category sections.  This application will currently have 4 pages of product categories that users can browse through and they are Sports & Outdoors, Tech, Clothing and DIY and once the users have chosen the products that they wish to purchase from category X, they can add it to their basket and proceed to the checkout. Customers can view the products added to the basket.  Before browsing for products, users are required to register and login into their account.  The main scope of this application is to allow end-users to shop for products in different categories, very similar to Amazon’s application.  After registration customers will receive a notification saying that they have registered successfully and the data from the registration will get sent to a back-end database. I will be making use of the Firebase Service to store the user’s registration data.  When customers have decided on what they want to purchase they can add the products to their basket and the users can view their basket in the form of a list view.  Users will be presented with a payment form where they are prompted to fill out their payment information and pay for the products chosen. After the payment is complete and processed users will receive an invoice through e-mail.  Each category with products will be shown on different activity pages on the application. For example, on page 1 the sports and outdoors category section will be displayed with the products available in stock etc.  I will be making use of version control using Git in order to track the changes made to the project and to also commit and push new changes when developing the application. In case I lose my work, I can revert back to previous commits to start from that checkpoint.  My initial inspiration for choosing this type of application was from the Amazon application.  I will be also making use of some Agile approaches such as Kanban Boards, Product Backlogs and Sprint Boards.",,1

Even if spam menace has clouted the email’s effectiveness, emails are still considered as the most effective marketing tool. Telephones and traditional postage are now considered as expensive direct marketing tools. Emails have become the multi-channel and global medium of business communication. This is the reason why appending emails for businesses can be helpful.  What Is Email Appending All about?  This is the process of matching the customer database that has no email addresses with the address database of the service provider with a view to append the missing information to customer database. It is done when organizations that have a customer database contain names, addresses, and telephone numbers wants to kick off the email communication with their clients. The business hires a provider of email appending services who has a big database that will append the email addresses. The provider will then match the list with their database and add the latest email addresses to the database. After the process of appending, permission is sought from the customers to send emails to them. The email append service provider will deploy the emails on behalf of the organization that hired them. The key goals of permission is twofold. This is to ensure that the address is the latest one and to make sure that the address is willing to get emails from the organization.  Finding a Good Email Append Service Provider  There are other several things you should know about appending emails for businesses. If you have decided to consider email appending services for your business, choose a provider that would offer you the best value of what you have spent. During these days, once you shop around, you will find a lot of companies claiming to deliver top notch email append services. Though most of them seem to be reputable, not all can guarantee you quality service.  When shopping around for a company for your business email list requirements, there are various factors you should not forget. One of these is to know their match rates. Even if some companies boast for having high match rates, most of these are too good to be true. Realistic match rates are often between twenty to thirty percent.  Knowing the current clients of the company is also essential. Email append service providers do not necessarily have to be household names, yet it can be reassuring to know a provider who helped clients of the same industry or size as your company.  High quality email append service provider must also be able to provide you hundred percent permission based email address match results. Moreover, you must weed out providers that do not send permission messages to their addresses just to confirm deliverability as well as give your clients the chance to opt-out before the results are returned.  Choosing a provider that can prove results may also be a good idea. With this, you can guarantee that your marketing investment is in safe hands.",,0

Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.  This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.  Data  The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:  Storm Data [47Mb] There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.  National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation  National Climatic Data Center Storm Events FAQ  The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.  Assignment  The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.  Questions  Your data analysis must address the following questions:  Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?  Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.  Requirements  For this assignment you will need some specific tools  RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.  knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML  Document Layout  Language: Your document should be written in English.  Title: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis  Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.  There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.  There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.  You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.  The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.  Your analyis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.  You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that echo = TRUE for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).  Publishing Your Analysis  For this assignment you will need to publish your analysis on RPubs.com. If you do not already have an account, then you will have to create a new account. After you have completed writing your analysis in RStudio, you can publish it to RPubs by doing the following:  In RStudio, make sure your R Markdown document (.Rmd) document is loaded in the editor  Click the Knit HTML button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.  In the preview window, click the Publish button.  Once your document is published to RPubs, you should get a unique URL to that document. Make a note of this URL as you will need it to submit your assignment.  NOTE: If you are having trouble connecting with RPubs due to proxy-related or other issues, you can upload your final analysis document file as a PDF to Coursera instead.  Submitting Your Assignment  In order to submit this assignment, you must copy the RPubs URL for your completed data analysis document in to the peer assessment question.""}",,0

I'm a software engineer, here to help you truly understand and develop your skills in web and REST API development with Python and Flask.  Production-ready REST APIs with Flask  This course will guide you in creating simple, intermediate, and advanced REST APIs including authentication, deployments, databases, and much more.  We'll start with a Python refresher that will take you from the very basics to some of the most advanced features of Python—that's all the Python you need to complete the course.  Using Flask and popular extensions Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy we will dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs.  We will also look into essential technologies Git, Heroku, and nginx.  You'll be able to...  Create resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and popular Flask extensions;  Handle secure user registration and authentication with Flask.  Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy to easily and efficiently store resources to a database; and  Understand the complex intricacies of deployments and the performance of Flask REST APIs.    But what is a REST API anyway?  A REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. For example, a REST API could accept text data from the client, such as a username and password, and return whether that is a valid user in the database.  When developing REST APIs, our clients are usually web apps or mobile apps. That's in contrast to when we make websites, where the clients are usually the users themselves.  Together we'll develop a REST API that not only allows clients to authenticate but also to store and retrieve any data you want from a database. Learning this will help you develop any REST API that you need for your own projects!    I pride myself on providing excellent support and feedback to every single student. I am always available to guide you and answer your questions.  I'll see you on the inside. Take your first step towards REST API mastery!

Our project aims at minimising this delay by immediately alerting the emergency services as soon as the accident occurs. This can be made possible by using a vibration sensor attached to the vehicle which detects a collision and instantly alerts our dedicated server(smartphone app) using a GSM modem.

If there is no response from the victim, our server administrator immediately alerts emergency services providing them with the details of the victim stored in our database(included in the mobile server app) and the location of the accident obtained from the GPS module.

812,https://github.com/NilishaC/Wind-Turbine-Predictive-Maintenance-.git,"Wind patterns across the globe vary over the year and can be unpredictable at times, with this variability in the wind leading to fluctuating loads on wind turbine components. A typical wind turbine consists of more than a dozen bearings that are expected to work simultaneously and continuously for many years. As a result, wind turbine bearings and gearboxes are often susceptible to failure well before their designed service lives. Bearing failures in wind turbines are a significant cause of downtime in energy production for unplanned maintenance, repairs and replacements. This failure resulted in a significant increase in operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for the wind energy operator and in higher utility bills for the customer. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Gearbox Reliability Database (GRD) shows that 76% of gearboxes failed due to bearings, while 17% failed due to gear failures. This shows the importance of reliable bearings and gearboxes for wind turbine operations to the economy and society.",,0

This was the first branch to be founded and holds importance in the company’s history. Throughout the years, multiple other branches have been opened all throughout the country, and the company now operates out of multiple locations. Each branch includes multiple departments which it oversees its function and work, with each department serving its own use as with any other company of such magnitude. Each branch also oversees its respective factory(s). Each branch is managed by one employee of the company (or in this case manager). When an employee works for a department or factory he/she by default works for Branch. All departments have more than one phone number as to reach the different personnel in charge of that department. Factories on the other hand are identified by its factory number. It is assumed that all factories use machinery. All machinery that is registered in the database is used only by the factories. Furthermore, each machine is identified by its serial number. The factory’s main function is to produce product and consume supplies, hence it is connected to both entities respectively. The main base the company’s function revolves around is the signing of contracts.it is assumed in this database that each type of item is supplied or sold through the signing of a contract by a supplier or customer respectively. Hence the contract entity includes the Quantity attribute because one contract is designed to deal with one type of item no matter the quantity. Every contract is identified by its unique contract ID that is generated when the contract is made. As soon as a supplier engages in dealings with the company, he is given a unique ID to represent the supplying company in the database. Only one contact person deals with the communication between the supplying company and our company. The same goes for the customer, but in this case, we also included an attribute called loyalty points. As a gesture of appreciation, the company likes to reward its customers who stick with it throughout time. These loyalty points stack up with each purchase and result in gifts or discounts on products when an invoice is issued in the contract entity (represented as the rewards attribute in contract). If, however a specific customer is deleted from the database and then rejoins, his loyalty points are zeroed and start again. In the case a customer does not purchase products from the company itself, he/she can buy the company’s products from local shops that belong to the company. These shops sell all the company products that can be bought from the company itself, however a customer is not contracted nor is he/she included in the database when such a purchase is made, hence it can be considered an “over the counter” purchase.

You may use ad hoc calculation, event sourcing, or whatever you see fit. These are the fields that must be returned by the API. You may add fields where necessary. Use cases ● user has to be able to create a job offer and read a single and list all offers. ● candidate has to be able to apply for an offer. ● user has to be able to read one and list all applications per offer. ● user has to be able to progress the status of an application. ● user has to be able to track the number of applications. ● status change triggers a notification (*) (*) a log output will suffice as a notification here, but you should design it as if each status change triggers a completely different business case. Technical requirements Use SpringBoot to build this service. The service must run standalone and must not require any third party software to be installed. The service must communicate Json over http (REST). Return proper status codes for the most common problems. The data does not have to be stored permanently, it may be handled in-memory during runtime. Use Hibernate to handle database operations.

Most boundaries represented by this shapefile are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates that occurred after January 1, 2013, such as newly incorporated places, are also included.  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.  In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.  The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

853,https://github.com/rebeccabartels/DMZExploitation.git,"{""# DMZ Exploitation This week, you will apply the techniques you learned in class to pivot across subnets and attack a DMZ.  ## Background on DMZs Most commonly, machines on a LAN send requests to the public Internet through a router, which forwards requests to the web after performing NAT, and forwards responses back to the requesting host on the LAN. This router typically has a firewall that only allows connections to/from certain ports, such as 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS) .  Network engineers can add an additional layer of protection to the network by installing a **DMZ (demilitarized zone)**, which acts as an additional layer of protection in front of an existing network.  Only a _single_ machine separates the LAN pictured above from the public Internet: the `pfSense` router. In a DMZ, a whole _network sits in between.  Recall that when machines on a LAN communicate on the Internet, they _all_ forward packets straight through the **default gateway**. When data comes back from the Internet, the gateway filters and forward it to the proper host on the LAN.  Data passes through two gateways on its way through a DMZ. First, it passes through a router from the Internet into a network called the DMZ.  This router typically runs a firewall that filters out all traffic that the organization doesn't expect—e.g., it may only allow connections to HTTP/HTTPS, email, and SSH ports into the DMZ.    ![Dual-firewall DMZ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/DMZ_network_diagram_2_firewall.svg/960px-DMZ_network_diagram_2_firewall.svg.png)   **Note**: This is Creative Commons: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DMZ_network_diagram_2_firewall.svg  From there, machines on the DMZ can forward requests to machines on the  internal network. Sensitive data is typically stored only in the internal network, _not_ on machines in the DMZ. Clients on the public Internet interact with that data by sending requests to the machines Interaction with that data is done _through_ machines in the DMZ, which act as proxies. This means that attackers who compromise a machine in the DMZ do _not_ immediately own the machines in the internal network, and because it gives network administrators fine control over _exactly_ how services from the internal network are exposed to the outside world.  One well-motivated use case for a DMZ is that of public web servers in a DMZ communicating with databases in an internal network.""}",,0

This can involve any task like Data Entry Services, data processing services, data management, data deduplication, voice process, back-end management, chat support, data analytics, digital marketing and much more. Outsourcing allows the companies to reduce overheads by as much as 60% and it lets you focus on your core competencies.  India - The preferred destination for global outsourcing India has been a pioneer in outsourcing globally and is expected to play a further big role in coming decades in outsourcing arena. India, has an obvious advantage in outsourcing compared to other nations. This can be summarized as follows:  1.Largest Global workforce: India, enjoys the privilege of having the largest global workforce in the world. With a population of over 1381 millions, India has the greatest number of people in the working age group (25-45). India is the youngest country on the planet. This gives an obvious advantage to India and entrepreneurs, around the globe, need to recognize this potential strength of India and use it to their advantage. With Government initiatives like Skill India, Digital India, today the skilled workforce is rising in India in outstanding numbers. That means that digital literacy has poured into the villages and small towns too. The potentially implies that there is a pool of talent available in India to do your non-core operations effectively which may include the data entry services, big data management projects, data processing  for large databases, eCommerce management, voice process, web development, App creation, etc. if you hire an agency in India to do the task, it would mean you spend way less money than you would otherwise spend in hiring people in house.  Second, it gives you access to largest manpower available to get your most exhaustive work at the click of a mouse.  2.Most appropriate Infrastructure for outsourcing: India, having been in outsourcing for a long time now, enjoys the advantage of having most advanced IT infrastructure in the country. For example, the launch of jio-fibre , 5G technology have ensured seem less connectivity PAN India and also you would get all required technology and tools available with outsourcing agencies in India.  3.Good communicators: With English being the primary medium of education in most private schools, you find good English-speaking people in India who ensures that the communication with the outsourcing team is up to the mark. 4.Quality Standards: There are good quality standards in India and there are various institutions for auditing the agencies that further ensures the good standards of work by the Indian outsourcing agencies  5.Hardworking staff: Being a country with growing population, there is a competition in the people to get better which allows the people to work harder and attain a good position for themselves. So, rather than the culture of sitting idle, India has evolved to a culture where people tend to work for more hours than other nations.  All these are the reasons that makes India the preferred outsourcing partner.

859,https://github.com/mgsionline/Medical-Billing-Outsourcing-Vs-In-House-Billing-Let-s-Discuss.git,"The modern physician always struggles to decide whether to go for Medical billing outsourcing or to have the entire billing p process in-house which can turn out to be a significant burden! This depends on the practice and factors like duration of their business, staff size and financial model of the particular healthcare Organization. Innovations in technology and government rules have led to more and more doctors opting for medical billing outsourcing. Medical billing, of course, is of utmost importance since it determines the cash flow of your practice. A healthcare facility must carefully analyse the market trend, its infrastructure and financial health before choosing between medical billing outsourcing and in-house billing. Here are some of the points that motivate the decision: Costs must be compared and calculated  Medical billing determines the growth of practice since the lack of a streamlined billing system leads to recurring expenses. A proper billing procedure which makes all the non-medical processes including follow up, collection and payments smooth can help a healthcare provider grow financially.  •    In-house medical billing as the name suggests is a scenario where the healthcare facility invests in taking care of the entire process themselves. This leads to the requirement of capital, searching for experienced coders and billers and keeping room for contingency and backlogs in case the in-house team is absent or not available. This often puts the entire revenue cycle at risk. •    Medical billing outsourcing, on the other hand, is a process in which a healthcare unit avails the services of medical billing service providers. There’s usually revenue exchange involved between the parties. This ensures that there’s timely claim submission because the medical billing service provider is familiar with ICD-10 coding and has expert medical billers and coders working for them. It is an extraordinarily feasible and flexible option although a smaller healthcare facility will need to budget carefully to provide for such a system. The Provider’s Convenience Matters  Doing the medical billing in-house obviously means that it can be continuously checked for transparency and accountability. However consistency, maintenance, and quality of service are the tough challenges when it comes to in-house billing. This is where medical billing outsourcing can be beneficial since a healthcare provider can concentrate on their primary responsibilities instead of worrying about billing related tasks. A medical billing provider will also give regular reports which can help in financial analysis and assessment. Safety Is Significant In-house medical billing can reduce security breaches, but it also means that employees need to be trained on a regular basis. Medical billing outsourcing, on the other hand, is far more up-to-date since a medical billing service provider continually updates itself according to the regulation and coding system changes. This ensures security and confidentiality of a patient’s health-related information.   The Possibility Of Scaling Up Medical billing outsourcing means that the health service provider can increase its requirements from time to time and these requirements will be handled by the billing provider seamlessly.  This is extremely difficult to do in the case of an in-house billing kind of setup. Outsourcing, therefore, allows a healthcare facility to expand without worries. The evolution of technology has caused the medical billing market to transform for the better. Now the primary concentration is on error minimisation, making regulations and maintaining databases. This has led to an increased dependence on medical billing outsourcing since a third party provider who specialises in billing can easily keep up with the changing times. However, it’s the healthcare unit’s call since they know their business the best. ",,0

869,https://github.com/rajnilprasad/Employee-Tracker-.git,"{""# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.  ## Instructions  Design the following database schema containing three tables:  ![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)  * **department**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name  * **role**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title   * **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary   * **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to  * **employee**:    * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY   * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name   * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name   * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has   * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager    Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:    * Add departments, roles, employees    * View departments, roles, employees    * Update employee roles  Bonus points if you're able to:    * Update employee managers    * View employees by manager    * Delete departments, roles, and employees    * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department  We can frame this challenge as follows:  ``` As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company So that I can organize and plan my business ```  How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:  * Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.  * Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.  * Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.  * You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?  * You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.  ![Employee Tracker](Assets/employee-tracker.gif)  ### Hints  * You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.  * Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.  * Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.  * Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.  ## Minimum Requirements  * Functional application.  * GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.  * The command-line application should allow users to:    * Add departments, roles, employees    * View departments, roles, employees    * Update employee roles  ## Bonus  * The command-line application should allow users to:    * Update employee managers    * View employees by manager    * Delete departments, roles, and employees    * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department  ## Commit Early and Often  One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:  * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.  * Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.  Follow these guidelines for committing:  * Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.  * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.  * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).  * Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.  We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!   ## Submission on BCS  You are required to submit the following:  * The URL of the GitHub repository  * A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality   - - - © 2019 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

Social media marketing requires a lot of testing and trying out different step; you can’t improve any particular aspect of it without knowing what signals to pay attention at. You can even use these different signals which will vary from channel to channel to define targets for your social media, efforts to help you stay motivated and on track process. Here are just some of the goals you should consider for your social media marketing, which you can add to your strategy over time are drive brand awareness, create demand for your products, acquire leads, get sales, drive offline traffic, network to form partnerships, build a loyal following, establish social proof and provide customer service become a thought leader in your target market are social media gives you a voice that you can use to not only participate in conversations, but shift them in the direction you think they should go in and build credibility around your products brand or services. All of your choices should aim to tick one or more of these boxes, and any ideas and new tactics you plan out to test should be evaluated on their potential to achieve these goals. Some of them may be long-term investments while others are more immediate reaction. Marketing, on and off social media, starts with understanding your ideal customer minds. Building a rich context about your target audience takes time, but there are steps you can take immediately that will put you in a better position at the start of the plan. Spend some time researching your target audience, looking for demographic and psychographic data or observable patterns that help you form a mental image of who is likely to buy from you. This exercise won’t just inform your initial strategy but also help you develop a voice and tone for your brand that resonates with them. If your business naturally focuses on a specific niche like cat owners, for example, your job will be easier than you have imagined if you’re trying to appeal to a more general audience like a telecommunications or airline brands. I recommend lurking in the places your intended customers often hang out, blog comments for example, to see what they’re interested in. Facebook, being one of the largest social media marketing services and thus it have a database of 2.3 billion monthly active users, is also a great place to do some audience research. Check out your competitors’ pages, clicking through on the profiles of some of their engaged followers to get a better sense of who they are and what they like. Once you’ve done some digging, you can put it all together to create an ideal customer, or buyer persona thing, who is likely to buy from you. You don’t have to fill out every trait, but describe what you can to paint an image of this person as it is relevant to your social media marketing agency will look for these location, age, gender, interests, career/industry, income level, relationship status, favourite sites/apps, and motivation to buy and buying concerns.",,0

879,https://github.com/Stu-Vic/sql-challenge.git,"It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:   Data Engineering   Data Analysis   Note: You may hear the term ""Data Modeling"" in place of ""Data Engineering,"" but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modeling.  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: EmployeeSQL.   Add your files to this folder.   Push the above changes to GitHub.    Instructions  Data Modeling Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.  Data Engineering   Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.  For the primary keys check to see if the column is unique, otherwise create a composite key. Which takes to primary keys in order to uniquely identify a row. Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.    Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. Note be sure to import the data in the same order that the tables were created and account for the headers when importing to avoid errors.    Data Analysis Once you have a complete database, do the following:   List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.   List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.   List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager\'s employee number, last name, first name.   List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.   List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is ""Hercules"" and last names begin with ""B.""   List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.   List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.   In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.    Bonus (Optional) As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:   Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name: from sqlalchemy import create_engine engine = create_engine(\'postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>\') connection = engine.connect()     Consult SQLAlchemy documentation for more information.   If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I and https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files for more information.     Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.   Create a bar chart of average salary by title.    Epilogue Evidence in hand, you march into your boss\'s office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, ""Search your ID number."" You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.  Submission   Create an image file of your ERD.   Create a .sql file of your table schemata.   Create a .sql file of your queries.   (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.   Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.    Copyright Trilogy Education Services © 2019. All Rights Reserved.",,0

881,https://github.com/wordware/Cafeteria-POS-Your-Schools-Need-Point-of-Sale-Systems-Wordware-s-LCS-1000-Mayflower-is-best-choice.git,"{""“Do you need a POS system for your cafeteria?” This is a question many school administrators have asked recently as they review their technology budgets. The answer to the question is probably “yes,” because school cafeteria POS systems offer a variety of advantages not afforded by traditional electronic cash registers. Let’s take a look at some of these benefits.  Cafeteria POS systems speed up service Students at K-12 schools typically have a very short window of time in which to purchase and eat their lunch, while those enrolled at colleges and universities are often on tight schedules between classes. With such features as custom screen layouts, quick card processing (“smart cards” for K-12 students and meal cards and/or credit and debit cards at the secondary level), and packaged commands, school cafeteria POS systems keep lines moving, ensuring that students consistently enjoy as much time as possible to consume their food. Cafeteria POS systems improve inventory management Cafeterias cater to hundreds or even thousands of students daily, meaning that they must manage a very sizeable inventory of perishable and non-perishable food and beverage items. They must ensure that they have sufficient quantities of ingredients and food on hand at all times, and that these items haven’t expired. Some schools must also follow federal guidelines that dictate which items they can and cannot serve, and to whom. A cafeteria POS system with an inventory management module makes it easier for schools to rise to these challenges. Cafeteria administrators and other appropriate personnel can calculate food costs by recipe and, through usage reports, get a firm handle on inventory in stock. This permits shortages and overages to be addressed proactively, eliminating waste and ensuring that food is used by its expiration date. The inventory management component of the cafeteria POS system can also be programmed to generate orders only when item levels have been depleted to a certain threshold, and to prevent the processing of orders that don’t meet certain parameters. Consequently, cafeterias are assured of having the right quantities of the right ingredients at the appropriate time. Waste is minimized, and adherence to all purchasing guidelines becomes the norm. Cafeteria POS systems make for happier parents and students Busy parents can forget to give their children lunch money. Occasionally, they can even find themselves ready to send their children to school, only to discover that they have no cash for lunch. By contrast, in schools with cafeteria POS systems, parents can simply load money onto students’ prepaid cards once a month (or in some districts, once a week). Parents are happy because there is no need to scramble for coins and bills every day, and children are happy because they no longer need to skip lunch or borrow money from a friend. Additionally, some cafeteria POS systems give parents an extra measure of control over which food items their children can and cannot buy in the school cafeteria. In these cases, student profiles are maintained in a database and, because of an interface with the POS, cashiers cannot process the purchase of any item a parent has deemed “forbidden.” This system allows parents to do payment for the entire family through one student.  Wordare, Inc. provides e-Funds For Schools to allow families to choose a couple of different online payment options for student lunch accounts. Parents may choose to have payments automatically withdrawn electronically from your checking account or charged to your credit card. There is a convenience fee for using this program.  The benefits of cafeteria POS systems far outweigh the initial cost, making them a worthwhile investment for any school, K-12 or secondary.  Why do I need a LCS account?

It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.  Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Like, Java was initially devised to control toasters and some other electronics. C was developed for programming OS. Pascal was conceptualized to teach proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It well deserves the widely acknowledged nickname ""Swiss Pocket Knife of Languages.""  C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.  C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.  The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.    About C++ Programming  Multi-paradigm Language - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.  General Purpose Language - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.  Speed - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.

C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.

Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them. Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.  Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.  C++ is still used widely, and the most famous software have their backbone in C++.  This tutorial will help you learn C++ basic and the advanced concepts.  Who uses C++?  Some of today\'s most visible used systems have their critical parts written in C++.  Examples are Amadeus (airline ticketing)  Bloomberg (financial formation), Amazon (Web commerce), Google (Web search) Facebook (social media)  Many programming languages depend on C++\'s performance and reliability in their implementation. Examples include:  Java Virtual Machines JavaScript interpreters (e.g., Google\'s V8) Browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla\'s Firefox, Apple\'s Safari, and Google\'s Chrome)  Application and Web frameworks (e.g., Microsoft\'s .NET Web services framework).  Applications that involve local and wide area networks, user interaction, numeric, graphics, and database access highly depend on C++ language.  Why Use C++  C++ is one of the world\'s most popular programming languages.  C++ can be found in today\'s operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.  C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.  C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.  C++ is fun and easy to learn!  As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa   Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean?  C++ is an object oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.  Some call C++ “C with classes” because it introduces object oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework.  C++ is pronounced ""see-plus-plus.""   C++ Variables  Variables are the backbone of any programming language.  A variable is merely a way to store some information for later use. We can retrieve this value or data by referring to a ""word"" that will describe this information.  Once declared and defined they may be used many times within the scope in which they were declared.   C++ Control Structures  When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as ""code flow.""  When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code.  You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of strict rules to decide the flow of program execution.   C++ Syntax  The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols.  Well, it\'s because an email address has its well-defined syntax. You need some combination of letters, numbers, potentially with underscores (_) or periods (.) in between, followed by an at the rate (@) symbol, followed by some website domain (company.com).  So, syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of well-functioning software.  But, if you don\'t abide by the rules of a programming language or syntax, you\'ll get errors.  C++ Tools  In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object) that helps you to get a certain job done promptly.  Well, this holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming is some piece of software which when used with the code allows you to program faster.  There are probably tens of thousands, if not millions of different tools across all the programming languages.  Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view them.   Types of C++ Errors  Another way to look at C++ in a practical sense is to start enumerating different kinds of errors that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution.  First, there are syntax errors where the code is actually written in an illegible way. This can be a misuse of punctuation, or the misspelling of a function command or anything else that compromises the integrity of the syntax as it is written.  Another fundamental type of error is a compiler error that simply tells the programmer the compiler was not able to do its work effectively. As a compiler language, C++ relies on the compiler to make the source code into machine readable code and optimize it in various ways.  A third type of error happens after the program has been successfully compiled. Runtime errors are not uncommon in C++ executables. What they represent is some lack of designated resource or non-working command in the executable program.  In other words, the syntax is right, and the program was compiled successfully, but as the program is doing its work, it encounters a problem, whether that has to do with interdependencies, operating system requirements or anything else in the general environment in which the program is trying to work.  Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object oriented programming works.",,0

C++ Control Structures When a program runs, the code is read by the compiler line by line (from top to bottom, and for the most part left to right). This is known as ""code flow."" When the code is being read from top to bottom, it may encounter a point where it needs to make a decision. Based on the decision, the program may jump to a different part of the code. It may even make the compiler re-run a specific piece again, or just skip a bunch of code. You could think of this process like if you were to choose from different courses from Guru99. You decide, click a link and skip a few pages. In the same way, a computer program has a set of strict rules to decide the flow of program execution. C++ Syntax The syntax is a layout of words, expression, and symbols. Well, it\'s because an email address has its well-defined syntax. You need some combination of letters, numbers, potentially with underscores (_) or periods (.) in between, followed by an at the rate (@) symbol, followed by some website domain (company.com). So, syntax in a programming language is much the same. They are some well-defined set of rules that allow you to create some piece of well-functioning software. But, if you don\'t abide by the rules of a programming language or syntax, you\'ll get errors. C++ Tools In the real world, a tool is something (usually a physical object) that helps you to get a certain job done promptly. Well, this holds true with the programming world too. A tool in programming is some piece of software which when used with the code allows you to program faster. There are probably tens of thousands, if not millions of different tools across all the programming languages. Most crucial tool, considered by many, is an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is a software which will make your coding life so much easier. IDEs ensure that your files and folders are organized and give you a nice and clean way to view them. Types of C++ Errors Another way to look at C++ in a practical sense is to start enumerating different kinds of errors that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution. First, there are syntax errors where the code is actually written in an illegible way. This can be a misuse of punctuation, or the misspelling of a function command or anything else that compromises the integrity of the syntax as it is written. Another fundamental type of error is a compiler error that simply tells the programmer the compiler was not able to do its work effectively. As a compiler language, C++ relies on the compiler to make the source code into machine readable code and optimize it in various ways. A third type of error happens after the program has been successfully compiled. Runtime errors are not uncommon in C++ executables. What they represent is some lack of designated resource or non-working command in the executable program. In other words, the syntax is right, and the program was compiled successfully, but as the program is doing its work, it encounters a problem, whether that has to do with interdependencies, operating system requirements or anything else in the general environment in which the program is trying to work. Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object oriented programming works.",,0
887,https://github.com/TamalSaha481-oss/student-percentage-cal.git,"Description  An online marks percentage calculator to measure the percentage of marks obtained in the examination. Enter the marks you have scored and also provide the total marks to find the exam mark percentage.  This project is constructed under the Ubuntu OS (16.04).  The software’s that are used in this project are php, html, apache2 and MySQL.   PHP is a recursive acronym for ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"". PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. The php version that is used in this project is php 7.2.24. At the first step we need create two files one is for html and one is for php. In the Html file the front end part takes place and in the php file the backend part exist. Before connecting the MySQL to the page, we need to create a database in the server and create a table in the database. So that the data that is entered in the html page gets entered into the sql.   MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. MySQL is an important component of an open source enterprise stack called LAMP.   Apache Web Server is an open-source web server creation, deployment and management software. Initially developed by a group of software programmers, it is now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. The html file is run on the localhost of the apache2.PHP is scripting language which does run directly on browser. for running them  you need to setup a server or use online server. For local server we will be using  **apache** and **php**.   Prerequisites: -  * Apache  * PHP  * MYSQL    Installing Prerequisites: -  For Apache: - sudo apt-get install apache2  For PHP: - sudo apt-get install php  For install MySQL: - sudo apt install mysql-server    Steps to run the code: -   Step 1: - After installing the Apache2,  Saving the old page of apache welcome. (In case you may need that in future.)   Step 2: -  Make a PHP file to write code in it.  sudo gedit /var/www/main.php   Step 3: -  Now open the the main.php shared file and copy the codes from it and paste it.  Or  You can skip **Step: 2** and copy the file directly into the html folder.  sudo cp main.php /var/www/   Step 4: -  Create the html page using sudo gedit /var/www/mainaapage.html  Restart Apache: sudo service apache2 restartRunning the tests: -  Open Your Browser and Enter localhost into address bar.  “localhost/htmlpage.html” then it should open the file and enter the marks as you require.

888,https://github.com/KMT123/Special-Banks-management-system.git,"BSVB is the special banks management system. It is an Online Banking Login which includes Managing Accounts, Statements, MiniStatements, Funds Transfer and more… While these are very plain vanilla services, the most important factor in these is that each one has a certain resource intensive nature and certain traffic. But within these lets say a Balance Enquiry via an ATM has higher frequency of usage and a need to served faster than say the request for an Old Bank Statement. For this purpose, in this project, we propose 2 separate Cloud Servers for the Bank. All transactions with data within 1 year shall remain in server 1 which is high end. The data that is older than 1 year moves to server 2 which is slightly lesser resource intensive thereby less expensive. So the project involves implementation of a data transfer system which keeps only data that is 1 year old within itself and transfers the remaining to another server. The task in this project begins with creating a very simple Banking application which shall be used by Admin and Customers. The Admin should be able to create new account and create a username, password for the customer owning that account. The admin should be able to add money and debit money from the account by logging on to the admin panel. The customer at any point of time should be able to login and search for his credits/debits in the account via a user interface. He has separate search forms, 1 for latest data, and a separate one for data older than 1 year. As the days progress every day, the data that was entered 1 year ago becomes old. So the developer needs to create a thread which wakes up everyday and searches for transactions on server 1 which are more than 1 year old. Since every day the date moves forward by 1, some transactions might get included in this list. The job of that thread is to pick up these entries in server 1 and make the same entries in the database of server 2. Once done, the entries of server 1 must be deleted.",,0

895,https://github.com/Ajay6140/KDD-Data---PVA-Fundraising-.git,"BACKGROUND ------------------------- The data set for this year\'s Cup has been generously provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). PVA is a not-for-profit organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease. With an in-house database of over 13 million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fund raisers in the country. Participants in the \'98 CUP will demonstrate the performance of their tool by analyzing the results of one of PVA\'s recent fund raising appeals. This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors who were on the PVA database as of June 1997. Everyone included in this mailing had made at least one prior donation to PVA. The mailing included a gift (or ""premium"") of personalized name & address labels plus an assortment of 10 note cards and envelopes. All of the donors who received this mailing were acquired by PVA through similar premium-oriented appeals such as this. One group that is of particular interest to PVA is ""Lapsed"" donors. These are individuals who made their last donation to PVA 13 to 24 months ago. They represent an important group to PVA, since the longer someone goes without donating, the less likely they will be to give again. Therefore, recapture of these former donors is a critical aspect of PVA\'s fund raising efforts. However, PVA has found that there is often an inverse correlation between likelihood to respond and the dollar amount of the gift, so a straight response model (a classification or discrimination task) will most likely net only very low dollar donors. High dollar donors will fall into the lower deciles, which would most likely be suppressed from future mailings. The lost revenue of these suppressed donors would then offset any gains due to the increased response rate of the low dollar donors. Therefore, to improve the cost-effectiveness of future direct marketing efforts, PVA wishes to develop a model that will help them maximize the net revenue (a regression or estimation task) generated from future renewal mailings to Lapsed donors. POPULATION ---------- The population for this analysis will be Lapsed PVA donors who received the June \'97 renewal mailing (appeal code ""97NK""). Therefore, the analysis data set contains a subset of the total universe who received the mailing. The analysis file includes all 191,779 Lapsed donors who received the mailing, with responders to the mailing marked with a flag in the TARGET_B field. The total dollar amount of each responder\'s gift is in the TARGET_D field. The overall response rate for this direct mail promotion is 5.1%. The package cost (including the mail cost) is $0.68 per piece mailed. ANALYSIS TIME FRAME AND REFERENCE DATE -------------------------------------- The 97NK mailing was sent out on June 1997. All information included in the file (excluding the giving history date fields) is reflective of behavior prior to 6/97. This date may be used as the reference date in generating the ""number of months since"" or ""time since"" or ""elapsed time"" variables. The participants could also find the reference date information in the filed ADATE_2. This filed contains the dates the 97NK promotion was mailed. +--------------------------------------------------------------------+ | DATA SOURCES and ORDER & TYPE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE DATA SETS | +--------------------------------------------------------------------+ The dataset includes: o 24 months of detailed PVA promotion and giving history (covering the   period 12 to 36 months prior to the ""97NK"" mailing) o A summary of the promotions sent to the donors over the most recent   12 months prior to the ""97NK"" mailing (by definition, none of these   donors responded to any of these promotions) o Summary variables reflecting each donor\'s lifetime giving history (e.g., total # of donations prior to ""97NK"" mailing, total $ amount of the donations, etc.) o Overlay demographics, including a mix of household and area level   data o All other available data from the PVA database (e.g., date of first gift, state, origin source, etc.) The fields are described in greater detail in the data dictionary file <filename: cup98DIC.txt>",,0

897,https://github.com/DARSHANIJAIN/LAMP.git,"{""Setting-up-LAMP-Stack-using-shell-scripting A shell script for installing LAMP on Debian OS  About LAMP The shortened form stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP that is used to set up web servers. The words most often used to describe LAMP are stable, simple, and powerful. It is considered as a stack is on the ground that each level infers off it's base layer. In the Working framework, Linux, is the base layer. At that point Apache, the web server sits on the operating system, and then database stores all the data served by the web server, and PHP or any other P* scripting language is utilized to drive and show all the information, and consider client connection.  Manually installing lamp on all servers can be repetitive and time consuming. Therefore, we have written a script that installs LAMP configures the necessary permissions and then, starts the web server.  What this script does: Updates the packages. Install Apache web server Install PHP and requirements Install MySQL Setting Permissions Enabling Modules STEP 1: Creating file for the script sudo gedit lamp.sh In the above command gedit is used to create file. Filename should be of format <filename.sh> .  STEP 2: Updating Apt Packages and upgrading latest patches sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y By running the above command it will update and upgrade the apt-get packages to their current versions in your system. It might take some time for the execution of this code.  NOTE: Use the below command if the code shows error while execution.  ps aux | grep -i apt STEP 3: Installing Apache2 Web server sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils libexpat1 ssl-cert -y The above command is used for installing the Apache web server on the linux which is acting as the base layer in LAMP stack.  STEP 4: Installing MySQL sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client -y The above command is used for installing MYSQL. It is used for collecting and storing the data as RDBMS.  STEP 5: Installing PHP & Requirements sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0 php7.0-common php7.0-curl php7.0-dev php7.0-gd php-pear php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-mysql -y The above command is used for installing PHP and requirements. PHP an object oriented scripting language is used to display the data in MySQL.  STEP 6: Setting Permissions sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www In the above command  the chown command changes the ownership to user:group i.e. www-data:www-data in our case. -R is used to change the ownership recursively for all files and directories in /var/www. STEP 7: Enabling Modules sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo phpenmod mcrypt In the above command a2enmod enables apache2 module and phpenmod enables php module.  STEP 8: Restarting Apache sudo service apache2 restart The above command is used to restart the apache2 web service.  Conclusion: Now the LAMP installation is completed. LAMP is so extensively and often used to update or host the existing applications, that’s why making it quicker and simple becomes more proficient.""}",,0
898,https://github.com/visoftwaresolutions/How-Blockchain-based-Crypto-wallets-Secures-your-online-transactions---VI-Software-Solutions.git,"{""Blockchain not only provides technology to build solutions for industries like financial services, healthcare, digital identity, digital contracts but also offers a platform for crypto wallet development and online payment solutions. Blockchain-powered crypto wallets ensure that users’ cryptocurrencies are safe from threats and hacks while enabling their exchange on different crypto trading platforms.A blockchain is a distributed database of records, or a public ledger of transactions or digital events that have been executed within the system. The premise of the underlying technology is that one centralised authority is not controlling or overseeing the transactions that take place and the record-keeping of those transactions  rather, a network of participants verifies the transaction by consensus, and once entered into the ledger, the transaction is irreversible.Blockchain is the biggest innovation in this modern business world to make the payment gateway safer for users. If we talk about blockchain wallets or a blockchain wallet application, they are designed mainly for fast and secure online payment management. It has made the payment system easier than ever. Due to this fact, the demand and popularity of the blockchain wallet development have continuously increased.    How exactly an online transaction works? It is a password protected payment method that authorizes transfer of funds over an electronic fund transfer(EFT).When you complete an online fund transaction through EFT by using your debit card with a personal identification number(PIN). When the exchange of fund is completed through EFT network, the cost of these transactions typically amounts an inter charge fee. which means a fixed percentage of your total transaction cost.  How blockchain based crypto wallets secures online payments? A blockchain wallet app consist of two keys namely public and private keys. The public key is shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret. These keys work in a very similar way to the concept of blocking and key: the block (private key) and the keys (public key).No matter how many people have the keys, they can only be useful if they are used to open the correct block, that is, the private key corresponds correctly with the public key. Once you unlock the locker, you can easily see what is stored in it. Similarly, when the private and public keys used in a transaction match, users can see the value of their digital assets (Bitcoins, ICO tokens, etc.) in their wallet. Understanding the concept of public and private keys that are on Blockchain for online payment is necessary. While the public key is available publicly for anyone, a user’s private key remains secret. These keys follow the same concept of lock and key: the lock (private key) and the keys (public key). Essentially, the private key needs to be correctly matched with the public key.When a private and a public key used in a transaction match, respective users can access the exchanged value of their digital assets (tokens) in their wallet.Based on how frequent online payment you make, you can choose between different types of blockchain wallets .    Types of blockchain based cryptocurrency wallets 1) Software wallets This type of wallet is similar to a software. Therefor you can install it on your PC and in mobile phones.It secures and controls your crypto currency transactions. 2) Web/Hosted Wallets This type of block chain wallets are like apps/platforms. mostly hosted by a third party. 3) Hardware Wallets To use hardware wallets you have to connect these wallets to an internet enabled device. How ever It is one of the safest wallet in use. It stores privet keys for users on a hardware device. Above all these type of wallets have compatibility with multiple web interfaces. So it render support for multiple crypto currencies. 4)Paper Wallets Paper wallets mostly works with software wallets for the purchase and sale of funds. The key pair ( Public and private) is induced using a software application and then printed to make a transaction process.   Various benefits of using blockchainbased crypto  wallets to secure online payments.  1) Easy fund transfer  The development of the Blockchain wallet app gained great popularity in a short time. A lot of companies have chosen this technology to make secure payments online. Most online payments are made through PayPal and bank payments, which force users to depend on the network and wait a while to complete the verification process. But after the development of the blockchain wallet application, it has released all unwanted things, such as bank charges for a transaction in the case of traditional methods. Now there are no transaction fees if you are using the Wallet Blockchain application  2) Easy to install  Since it is a blockchain wallet application for smartphones that you can easily find in an app store and can install it on your device. Therefore, choose the blockchain wallet application that suits the operating system of your mobile device and install it. In addition, you can also choose those applications that can be easily installed on both platforms, iOS and Android, for the blockchain portfolio.   3) More security It is always risky when you make online payments through the bank using the ATM PIN and password, as it carries the threat of hacking confidential data by hackers. However, due to the development of the blockchain wallet application, online payments have been protected and there is no possibility of hacking data when two parties carry out an online transaction.  Only interested persons are involved when the transaction is made through cryptocurrencies. No one knows about the payment information due to the lack of secrecy. The development of the Blockchain wallet application is necessary for the wallet to be more powerful. A combination of public and private key is required at both ends to make a transaction.  4) No  download Blockchain mobile wallets are developed by experienced developers and can be used by merchants, consumers and organizations with confidence. It is not necessary to download all transaction history in the form of a chain of blocks on your mobile device. Your blockchain wallet application automatically connects to the network and allows you to manage your Bitcoins.  5) No impact of inflation There is no impact of inflation on the development of the Blockchain wallet application. The Blockchain wallet application is an exception in case the prices of the products go up or down. The currency issued by the government will have influenced when inflation in the price of commodities. Where the Bitcoin value will not change, so you can easily perform your transaction online without confusion. Building your own blockchain portfolio is much better for online transactions where the benefit remains unique.

Can be used multiple times to        load multiple wallets. Path is to a directory containing wallet        data and log files. If the path is not absolute, it is        interpreted relative to <walletdir>. This only loads existing        wallets and does not create new ones. For backwards compatibility        this also accepts names of existing top-level data files in        <walletdir>.    -walletbroadcast        Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)    -walletdir=<dir>        Specify directory to hold wallets (default: <datadir>/wallets if it        exists, otherwise <datadir>)    -walletnotify=<cmd>        Execute command when a wallet transaction changes. %s in cmd is replaced        by TxID and %w is replaced by wallet name. %w is not currently        implemented on windows. On systems where %w is supported, it        should NOT be quoted because this would break shell escaping used        to invoke the command.    -walletrbf        Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled (RPC only, default: 0)  ZeroMQ notification options:    -zmqpubhashblock=<address>        Enable publish hash block in <address>    -zmqpubhashblockhwm=<n>        Set publish hash block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubhashtx=<address>        Enable publish hash transaction in <address>    -zmqpubhashtxhwm=<n>        Set publish hash transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubrawblock=<address>        Enable publish raw block in <address>    -zmqpubrawblockhwm=<n>        Set publish raw block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubrawtx=<address>        Enable publish raw transaction in <address>    -zmqpubrawtxhwm=<n>        Set publish raw transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubsequence=<address>        Enable publish hash block and tx sequence in <address>    -zmqpubsequencehwm=<n>        Set publish hash sequence message high water mark (default: 1000)  Debugging/Testing options:    -debug=<category>        Output debugging information (default: -nodebug, supplying <category> is        optional).
