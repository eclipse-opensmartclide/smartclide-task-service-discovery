This research paper aims to examine and illustrate how to use deep learning technologies and algorithms to precisely classify a dataset of fashion images into their respective clothing categories. First, the paper shows the general knowledge of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the techniques of image classification. Later on, it also discusses the methodology of building a neural network and the simulation process.

Consequently, this hype has yielded several innovative ideas to build open-source libraries and methods to enable the average income tech-savvies to achieve their objective. This research paper aims to examine and illustrate how to use deep learning technologies and algorithms to precisely classify a dataset of fashion images into their respective clothing categories. First, the paper shows the general knowledge of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the techniques of image classification. Later on, it also discusses the methodology of building a neural network and the simulation process. The results of the neural network simulation are compressively evaluated and discussed.""}","cnn-keras,cnn-classification,python3,code,report,deep-neural-networks,image-classification,fashion-mnist-dataset,fashion-classifier,tensorflow-models,tensorflow",2

Although the dataset is relatively simple, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data.  In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a convolutional neural network for clothing classification from scratch.  After completing this tutorial, you will know:  How to develop a test harness to develop a robust evaluation of a model and establish a baseline of performance for a classification task. How to explore extensions to a baseline model to improve learning and model capacity. How to develop a finalized model, evaluate the performance of the final model, and use it to make predictions on new images. Discover how to build models for photo classification, object detection, face recognition, and more in my new computer vision book, with 30 step-by-step tutorials and full source code.

(3 Punch outs) Look around the area to find special coins. The game will last 15 minutes, or until Husband\'s punch out meter is empty. Husband and wife are completely customizable from clothing to facial features. Each session will allow a swap out where if you played the husband and won/loss you\'d become the wife. Vice Versa for the other player/CPU. It has a more competitive game play. But will also have a collectible game play where the coins can purchase Outfit or certain designs. There will also be hidden designs in the game for players to find. Replay-ability is key here. We want people to play and play and play. I suggests we have a leaderboard for more competitive play and mini - games. Like a coin run. Already have a name for it; ""Silver-coin Trail.""  Marketing: We can market this game after we get the licenses from Maya, and Unity. Sale price would range $1.99 - $2.99. Not much, but we\'re getting our feet wet before jumping into the industry pool. Platforms include: Steam, PSN and Microsoft store. Well talk more about IOS and the App store at a later time. Remember we don\'t get paid, If we get paid, till the game becomes licensed. Don\'t want to become criminals. I\'ll see about building a Patron so we can rush the Licensing process and also get some support for the game development. Networking the game will be difficult but fair. Using platforms like YouTube, itch.io, and Simmer. We need the Demo and we\'ll show case the game play and put it out in social media. We\'ll see about attending some local areas for Indie game devs. Keep eyes and ears open for different events. In case, we get an opportunity to show case it.",,1
1681,https://github.com/itanand/Eccomerce-App-Website.git,"Project Proposal üóì I am planning on designing and implementing an e-Commerce shopping application in Android that will allow end-users to register, login to the app and browse for products in different category sections.  This application will currently have 4 pages of product categories that users can browse through and they are Sports & Outdoors, Tech, Clothing and DIY and once the users have chosen the products that they wish to purchase from category X, they can add it to their basket and proceed to the checkout. Customers can view the products added to the basket.  Before browsing for products, users are required to register and login into their account.  The main scope of this application is to allow end-users to shop for products in different categories, very similar to Amazon‚Äôs application.  After registration customers will receive a notification saying that they have registered successfully and the data from the registration will get sent to a back-end database. I will be making use of the Firebase Service to store the user‚Äôs registration data.  When customers have decided on what they want to purchase they can add the products to their basket and the users can view their basket in the form of a list view.  Users will be presented with a payment form where they are prompted to fill out their payment information and pay for the products chosen. After the payment is complete and processed users will receive an invoice through e-mail.  Each category with products will be shown on different activity pages on the application. For example, on page 1 the sports and outdoors category section will be displayed with the products available in stock etc.  I will be making use of version control using Git in order to track the changes made to the project and to also commit and push new changes when developing the application. In case I lose my work, I can revert back to previous commits to start from that checkpoint.  My initial inspiration for choosing this type of application was from the Amazon application.  I will be also making use of some Agile approaches such as Kanban Boards, Product Backlogs and Sprint Boards.",,1

1684,https://github.com/spt3gntlmn/MySQL-Homework.git,"Node.js & MySQL   Overview  In this activity, you\'ll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store\'s inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store\'s departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.   Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file.   Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options). Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.  Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.   If you haven\'t written a markdown file yet, click here for a rundown, or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.   Instructions   Challenge #1: Customer View (Minimum Requirement)   Create a MySQL Database called bamazon. Then create a Table inside of that database called products. The products table should have each of the following columns:    item_id (unique id for each product) product_name (Name of product) department_name price (cost to customer) stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)    Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert ""mock"" data rows into this database and table). Then create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. The app should then prompt users with two messages.    The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy. The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.    Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer\'s request.    If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.    However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer\'s order.   This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity. Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.        If this activity took you between 8-10 hours, then you\'ve put enough time into this assignment. Feel free to stop here -- unless you want to take on the next challenge.      Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)    Create a new Node application called bamazonManager.js. Running this application will:   List a set of menu options: View Products for Sale View Low Inventory Add to Inventory Add New Product If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities. If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five. If a manager selects Add to Inventory, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager ""add more"" of any item currently in the store. If a manager selects Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.        If you finished Challenge #2 and put in all the hours you were willing to spend on this activity, then rest easy! Otherwise continue to the next and final challenge.      Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)   Create a new MySQL table called departments. Your table should include the following columns:    department_id department_name over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)    Modify the products table so that there\'s a product_sales column and modify the bamazonCustomer.js app so that this value is updated with each individual products total revenue from each sale. Modify your bamazonCustomer.js app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product\'s product_sales column.    Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the products column.    Create another Node app called bamazonSupervisor.js. Running this application will list a set of menu options:    View Product Sales by Department Create New Department    When a supervisor selects View Product Sales by Department, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.      department_id department_name over_head_costs product_sales total_profit     01 Electronics 10000 20000 10000   02 Clothing 60000 100000 40000      The total_profit column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between over_head_costs and product_sales. total_profit should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias. If you can\'t get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add total_profit to the departments table.    Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL. Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs. Hint: You may need to look into JOINS. HINT: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What\'s is it? Good question :)      Minimum Requirements  Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed.     Create a README.md  Add a README.md to your repository describing the project. Here are some resources for creating your README.md. Here are some resources to help you along the way:   About READMEs Mastering Markdown      Add To Your Portfolio  After completing the homework please add the piece to your portfolio. Make sure to add a link to your updated portfolio in the comments section of your homework so the TAs can easily ensure you completed this step when they are grading the assignment. To receive an \'A\' on any assignment, you must link to it from your portfolio.     One More Thing  If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you\'re still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.  Good Luck!",,1
