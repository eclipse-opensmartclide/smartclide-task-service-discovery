0,https://github.com/NAalytics/Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273.git,"RNA vaccines have become a key tool in moving forward through the challenges raised both in the current pandemic and in numerous other public health and medical challenges.  With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations.  Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs.  Standard methods facilitate such sequencing.  In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.  Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has the benefit of allowing any researchers or clinicians using sequencing approaches to rapidly identify such sequences as therapeutic-derived rather than host or infectious in origin.   For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use.  To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.    Although our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ‚ÑÉ) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA.  Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations.  We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-- so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable.  But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation.   For further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94‚ÑÉ, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTerer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing.  As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).  From these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly.  This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out.  Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets.  The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference.   RNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243).  In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand.  In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol.  Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%).  Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents the actual dsRNA content in the original material.  This work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.  ProtoAcknowledgements: Thanks to our colleagues for help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Bijoyita Roy).  Figure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine.  Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the RNA.  Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/].  The 5‚Äô end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.

We will learn Classification algorithms, types of classification algorithms, support vector machines(SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier in this tutorial.  Objectives Let us look at some of the objectives covered under this section of Machine Learning tutorial.  Define Classification and list its algorithms Describe Logistic Regression and Sigmoid Probability Explain K-Nearest Neighbors and KNN classification Understand Support Vector Machines, Polynomial Kernel, and Kernel Trick Analyze Kernel Support Vector Machines with an example Implement the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier Demonstrate Decision Tree Classifier Describe Random Forest Classifier Classification: Meaning Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.  There are 2 types of Classification:   Binomial Multi-Class Classification: Use Cases Some of the key areas where classification cases are being used:  To find whether an email received is a spam or ham To identify customer segments To find if a bank loan is granted To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination Classification: Example Social media sentiment analysis has two potential outcomes, positive or negative, as displayed by the chart given below.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/classification-example-machine-learning.JPG  This chart shows the classification of the Iris flower dataset into its three sub-species indicated by codes 0, 1, and 2. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-flower-dataset-graph.JPG  The test set dots represent the assignment of new test data points to one class or the other based on the trained classifier model. Types of Classification Algorithms Let‚Äôs have a quick look into the types of Classification Algorithm below.  Linear Models Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines Nonlinear models K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) Na√Øve Bayes Decision Tree Classification Random Forest Classification Logistic Regression: Meaning Let us understand the Logistic Regression model below.  This refers to a regression model that is used for classification. This method is widely used for binary classification problems. It can also be extended to multi-class classification problems. Here, the dependent variable is categorical: y œµ {0, 1} A binary dependent variable can have only two values, like 0 or 1, win or lose, pass or fail, healthy or sick, etc In this case, you model the probability distribution of output y as 1 or 0. This is called the sigmoid probability (œÉ). If œÉ(Œ∏ Tx) > 0.5, set y = 1, else set y = 0 Unlike Linear Regression (and its Normal Equation solution), there is no closed form solution for finding optimal weights of Logistic Regression. Instead, you must solve this with maximum likelihood estimation (a probability model to detect the maximum likelihood of something happening). It can be used to calculate the probability of a given outcome in a binary model, like the probability of being classified as sick or passing an exam. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/logistic-regression-example-graph.JPG  Sigmoid Probability The probability in the logistic regression is often represented by the Sigmoid function (also called the logistic function or the S-curve):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-function-machine-learning.JPG  In this equation, t represents data values * the number of hours studied and S(t) represents the probability of passing the exam. Assume sigmoid function: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-probability-machine-learning.JPG  g(z) tends toward 1 as z -> infinity , and g(z) tends toward 0 as z -> infinity  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) K-nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to assign a data point to clusters based on similarity measurement. It uses a supervised method for classification.  The steps to writing a k-means algorithm are as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-distribution-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Choose the number of k and a distance metric. (k = 5 is common) Find k-nearest neighbors of the sample that you want to classify Assign the class label by majority vote. KNN Classification A new input point is classified in the category such that it has the most number of neighbors from that category. For example:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-classification-machine-learning.JPG  Classify a patient as high risk or low risk. Mark email as spam or ham. Keen on learning about Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning? Click here!  Support Vector Machine (SVM) Let us understand Support Vector Machine (SVM) in detail below.  SVMs are classification algorithms used to assign data to various classes. They involve detecting hyperplanes which segregate data into classes. SVMs are very versatile and are also capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and outlier detection. Once ideal hyperplanes are discovered, new data points can be easily classified. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/support-vector-machines-graph-machine-learning.JPG  The optimization objective is to find ‚Äúmaximum margin hyperplane‚Äù that is farthest from the closest points in the two classes (these points are called support vectors). In the given figure, the middle line represents the hyperplane. SVM Example Let‚Äôs look at this image below and have an idea about SVM in general.  Hyperplanes with larger margins have lower generalization error. The positive and negative hyperplanes are represented by: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/positive-negative-hyperplanes-machine-learning.JPG  Classification of any new input sample xtest :  If w0 + wTxtest > 1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the right of the positive hyperplane. If w0 + wTxtest < -1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the left of the negative hyperplane. When you subtract the two equations, you get:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/equation-subtraction-machine-learning.JPG  Length of vector w is (L2 norm length):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/length-of-vector-machine-learning.JPG  You normalize with the length of w to arrive at:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/normalize-equation-machine-learning.JPG  SVM: Hard Margin Classification Given below are some points to understand Hard Margin Classification.  The left side of equation SVM-1 given above can be interpreted as the distance between the positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) hyperplanes; in other words, it is the margin that can be maximized. Hence the objective of the function is to maximize with the constraint that the samples are classified correctly, which is represented as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-machine-learning.JPG  This means that you are minimizing ‚Äñw‚Äñ. This also means that all positive samples are on one side of the positive hyperplane and all negative samples are on the other side of the negative hyperplane. This can be written concisely as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-formula.JPG  Minimizing ‚Äñw‚Äñ is the same as minimizing. This figure is better as it is differentiable even at w = 0. The approach listed above is called ‚Äúhard margin linear SVM classifier.‚Äù SVM: Soft Margin Classification   Given below are some points to understand Soft Margin Classification.  To allow for linear constraints to be relaxed for nonlinearly separable data, a slack variable is introduced. (i) measures how much ith instance is allowed to violate the margin. The slack variable is simply added to the linear constraints. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-machine-learning.JPG  Subject to the above constraints, the new objective to be minimized becomes: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-formula.JPG  You have two conflicting objectives now‚Äîminimizing slack variable to reduce margin violations and minimizing to increase the margin. The hyperparameter C allows us to define this trade-off. Large values of C correspond to larger error penalties (so smaller margins), whereas smaller values of C allow for higher misclassification errors and larger margins. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/machine-learning-certification-video-preview.jpg  SVM: Regularization The concept of C is the reverse of regularization. Higher C means lower regularization, which increases bias and lowers the variance (causing overfitting).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/concept-of-c-graph-machine-learning.JPG  IRIS Data Set The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 IRIS flowers from three different species:  Setosa Versicolor Viriginica Each row represents one sample. Flower measurements in centimeters are stored as columns. These are called features.  IRIS Data Set: SVM Let‚Äôs train an SVM model using sci-kit-learn for the Iris dataset:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/svm-model-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Nonlinear SVM Classification There are two ways to solve nonlinear SVMs:  by adding polynomial features by adding similarity features Polynomial features can be added to datasets; in some cases, this can create a linearly separable dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/nonlinear-classification-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the figure on the left, there is only 1 feature x1. This dataset is not linearly separable. If you add x2 = (x1)2 (figure on the right), the data becomes linearly separable. Polynomial Kernel In sci-kit-learn, one can use a Pipeline class for creating polynomial features. Classification results for the Moons dataset are shown in the figure.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-machine-learning.JPG  Polynomial Kernel with Kernel Trick Let us look at the image below and understand Kernel Trick in detail.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-with-kernel-trick.JPG  For large dimensional datasets, adding too many polynomial features can slow down the model. You can apply a kernel trick with the effect of polynomial features without actually adding them. The code is shown (SVC class) below trains an SVM classifier using a 3rd-degree polynomial kernel but with a kernel trick. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-equation-machine-learning.JPG  The hyperparameter coefŒ∏ controls the influence of high-degree polynomials.  Kernel SVM Let us understand in detail about Kernel SVM.  Kernel SVMs are used for classification of nonlinear data. In the chart, nonlinear data is projected into a higher dimensional space via a mapping function where it becomes linearly separable. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the higher dimension, a linear separating hyperplane can be derived and used for classification.  A reverse projection of the higher dimension back to original feature space takes it back to nonlinear shape.  As mentioned previously, SVMs can be kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems. You can create a sample dataset for XOR gate (nonlinear problem) from NumPy. 100 samples will be assigned the class sample 1, and 100 samples will be assigned the class label -1. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-graph-machine-learning.JPG  As you can see, this data is not linearly separable.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-non-separable.JPG  You now use the kernel trick to classify XOR dataset created earlier.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-xor-machine-learning.JPG  Na√Øve Bayes Classifier What is Naive Bayes Classifier?  Have you ever wondered how your mail provider implements spam filtering or how online news channels perform news text classification or even how companies perform sentiment analysis of their audience on social media? All of this and more are done through a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes Classifier.  Naive Bayes Named after Thomas Bayes from the 1700s who first coined this in the Western literature. Naive Bayes classifier works on the principle of conditional probability as given by the Bayes theorem.  Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier Listed below are six benefits of Naive Bayes Classifier.  Very simple and easy to implement Needs less training data Handles both continuous and discrete data Highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points As it is fast, it can be used in real-time predictions Not sensitive to irrelevant features Bayes Theorem We will understand Bayes Theorem in detail from the points mentioned below.  According to the Bayes model, the conditional probability P(Y|X) can be calculated as:  P(Y|X) = P(X|Y)P(Y) / P(X)  This means you have to estimate a very large number of P(X|Y) probabilities for a relatively small vector space X. For example, for a Boolean Y and 30 possible Boolean attributes in the X vector, you will have to estimate 3 billion probabilities P(X|Y). To make it practical, a Na√Øve Bayes classifier is used, which assumes conditional independence of P(X) to each other, with a given value of Y. This reduces the number of probability estimates to 2*30=60 in the above example. Na√Øve Bayes Classifier for SMS Spam Detection Consider a labeled SMS database having 5574 messages. It has messages as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-machine-learning.JPG  Each message is marked as spam or ham in the data set. Let‚Äôs train a model with Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to detect spam from ham. The message lengths and their frequency (in the training dataset) are as shown below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-spam-detection.JPG  Analyze the logic you use to train an algorithm to detect spam:  Split each message into individual words/tokens (bag of words). Lemmatize the data (each word takes its base form, like ‚Äúwalking‚Äù or ‚Äúwalked‚Äù is replaced with ‚Äúwalk‚Äù). Convert data to vectors using scikit-learn module CountVectorizer. Run TFIDF to remove common words like ‚Äúis,‚Äù ‚Äúare,‚Äù ‚Äúand.‚Äù Now apply scikit-learn module for Na√Øve Bayes MultinomialNB to get the Spam Detector. This spam detector can then be used to classify a random new message as spam or ham. Next, the accuracy of the spam detector is checked using the Confusion Matrix. For the SMS spam example above, the confusion matrix is shown on the right. Accuracy Rate = Correct / Total = (4827 + 592)/5574 = 97.21% Error Rate = Wrong / Total = (155 + 0)/5574 = 2.78% https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/confusion-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Although confusion Matrix is useful, some more precise metrics are provided by Precision and Recall.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-recall-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Precision refers to the accuracy of positive predictions.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Recall refers to the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier (also known as True positive rate or TPR).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/recall-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Precision/Recall Trade-off To detect age-appropriate videos for kids, you need high precision (low recall) to ensure that only safe videos make the cut (even though a few safe videos may be left out).  The high recall is needed (low precision is acceptable) in-store surveillance to catch shoplifters; a few false alarms are acceptable, but all shoplifters must be caught.  Learn about Naive Bayes in detail. Click here!  Decision Tree Classifier Some aspects of the Decision Tree Classifier mentioned below are.  Decision Trees (DT) can be used both for classification and regression. The advantage of decision trees is that they require very little data preparation. They do not require feature scaling or centering at all. They are also the fundamental components of Random Forests, one of the most powerful ML algorithms. Unlike Random Forests and Neural Networks (which do black-box modeling), Decision Trees are white box models, which means that inner workings of these models are clearly understood. In the case of classification, the data is segregated based on a series of questions. Any new data point is assigned to the selected leaf node. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-machine-learning.JPG  Start at the tree root and split the data on the feature using the decision algorithm, resulting in the largest information gain (IG). This splitting procedure is then repeated in an iterative process at each child node until the leaves are pure. This means that the samples at each node belonging to the same class. In practice, you can set a limit on the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting. The purity is compromised here as the final leaves may still have some impurity. The figure shows the classification of the Iris dataset. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-graph.JPG  IRIS Decision Tree Let‚Äôs build a Decision Tree using scikit-learn for the Iris flower dataset and also visualize it using export_graphviz API.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-machine-learning.JPG  The output of export_graphviz can be converted into png format:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-output.JPG  Sample attribute stands for the number of training instances the node applies to. Value attribute stands for the number of training instances of each class the node applies to. Gini impurity measures the node‚Äôs impurity. A node is ‚Äúpure‚Äù (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/impurity-formula-machine-learning.JPG  For example, for Versicolor (green color node), the Gini is 1-(0/54)2 -(49/54)2 -(5/54) 2 ‚âà 0.168  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-sample.JPG  Decision Boundaries Let us learn to create decision boundaries below.  For the first node (depth 0), the solid line splits the data (Iris-Setosa on left). Gini is 0 for Setosa node, so no further split is possible. The second node (depth 1) splits the data into Versicolor and Virginica. If max_depth were set as 3, a third split would happen (vertical dotted line). https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-boundaries.JPG  For a sample with petal length 5 cm and petal width 1.5 cm, the tree traverses to depth 2 left node, so the probability predictions for this sample are 0% for Iris-Setosa (0/54), 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor (49/54), and 9.3% for Iris-Virginica (5/54) CART Training Algorithm Scikit-learn uses Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to train Decision Trees. CART algorithm:  Split the data into two subsets using a single feature k and threshold tk (example, petal length < ‚Äú2.45 cm‚Äù). This is done recursively for each node. k and tk are chosen such that they produce the purest subsets (weighted by their size). The objective is to minimize the cost function as given below: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/cart-training-algorithm-machine-learning.JPG  The algorithm stops executing if one of the following situations occurs: max_depth is reached No further splits are found for each node Other hyperparameters may be used to stop the tree: min_samples_split min_samples_leaf min_weight_fraction_leaf max_leaf_nodes Gini Impurity or Entropy Entropy is one more measure of impurity and can be used in place of Gini.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/gini-impurity-entrophy.JPG  It is a degree of uncertainty, and Information Gain is the reduction that occurs in entropy as one traverses down the tree. Entropy is zero for a DT node when the node contains instances of only one class. Entropy for depth 2 left node in the example given above is:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/entrophy-for-depth-2.JPG  Gini and Entropy both lead to similar trees.  DT: Regularization The following figure shows two decision trees on the moons dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/dt-regularization-machine-learning.JPG  The decision tree on the right is restricted by min_samples_leaf = 4. The model on the left is overfitting, while the model on the right generalizes better. Random Forest Classifier Let us have an understanding of Random Forest Classifier below.  A random forest can be considered an ensemble of decision trees (Ensemble learning). Random Forest algorithm: Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n samples from the training set). Grow a decision tree from the bootstrap sample. At each node, randomly select d features. Split the node using the feature that provides the best split according to the objective function, for instance by maximizing the information gain. Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times. (k is the number of trees you want to create, using a subset of samples) Aggregate the prediction by each tree for a new data point to assign the class label by majority vote (pick the group selected by the most number of trees and assign new data point to that group). Random Forests are opaque, which means it is difficult to visualize their inner workings. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/random-forest-classifier-graph.JPG  However, the advantages outweigh their limitations since you do not have to worry about hyperparameters except k, which stands for the number of decision trees to be created from a subset of samples. RF is quite robust to noise from the individual decision trees. Hence, you need not prune individual decision trees. The larger the number of decision trees, the more accurate the Random Forest prediction is. (This, however, comes with higher computation cost). Key Takeaways Let us quickly run through what we have learned so far in this Classification tutorial.  Classification algorithms are supervised learning methods to split data into classes. They can work on Linear Data as well as Nonlinear Data. Logistic Regression can classify data based on weighted parameters and sigmoid conversion to calculate the probability of classes. K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses similar features to classify data. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify data by detecting the maximum margin hyperplane between data classes. Na√Øve Bayes, a simplified Bayes Model, can help classify data using conditional probability models. Decision Trees are powerful classifiers and use tree splitting logic until pure or somewhat pure leaf node classes are attained. Random Forests apply Ensemble Learning to Decision Trees for more accurate classification predictions. Conclusion This completes ‚ÄòClassification‚Äô tutorial. In the next tutorial, we will learn 'Unsupervised Learning with Clustering.'""}",,26

The controller must be robust to external disturbances, such as road surface, weather, wind conditions, and so on. It also needs to deal with internal variations of vehicle sub-systems, including powertrain inefficiency, measurement errors, time delay, etc. These factors introduce issues in controller performance. In this paper, a feed-forward compensator is designed via a data-driven method to model and optimize the controller‚Äôs performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for extracting influential features, after which a Time Delay Neural Network is adopted to predict control errors over a future time horizon. Based on the predicted error, a feedforward compensator is then designed to improve control performance. Simulation results in different scenarios show that, with the help of with the proposed feedforward compensator, the maximum path tracking error and the steering wheel angle oscillation are improved by 44.4% and 26.7%, respectively.",,14
0,https://github.com/maazmb/LEP-Hybrid-Visual-Odometry.git,"We propose a novel real time monocular Hybrid visual odometry formulation which combines the high precision of indirect approaches with the fast performance of direct methods. The system initializes inverse depth estimates represented as a Gaussian probability distribution for features (lines, edges and points) extracted in each keyframe which we continuously propagate and update with new measurements in the following frames. The key idea is to incorporate the depth filter distributions into the initial pose tracking via sparse image alignment and also the pose refinement via map localization. We also propose a comprehensive initialization method of these depth filters and classify the map points into different categories based on the uncertainty of these depth estimates which as a result greatly improves the tracking performance. The experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed approach is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms while achieving comparable accuracy. We make our implementation publically open source at github to provide as a valuable reference for the SLAM community.  ",,14

There are several works using computer vision techniques. But there is no existing method that help to solve the all basic needs of blind person. This project presents a comprehensive scheme for reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) model from a stereo camera via multi-view calibration. The depth information is useful so as to estimate the actual position of the target object. It is an essential parameter that can allow visualization from multiple perspectives. We provide an improved method for detecting objects and calculating the distance of these objects using stereo vision in real time. The stages involved include camera calibration, image rectifying, disparity calculation, and three dimensional reconstruction. Results show that objects located from 65cm up to 203cm are properly measured for their distances, with an average error of 3cm. The precision of the measurement also depends on the quality of the calibration.",,13

Infrared  and  visible spectral   data   from   satellites   have   been   extensively   used   for rainfall prediction. In this study, two deep learning methods MLP and  LSTM  are  discussed  at  length  for  predicting  precipitation at a fine spatial (10km √ó 10km) and temporal (hourly) resolution for  the  state  of  Gujarat.  These  methods  are  applied  by  using the  multispectral  (VIS,  SWIR,  MIR,  WV,  TIR1,  TIR2)  channel data  such  as  cloud  top  temperature  and  radiance  values  of  the INSAT-3D  satellite  (ISRO)  as  features  for  the  model.  Textural features   of   satellite   images   are   incorporated   by   considering mean  and  standard  deviation  of  each  pixel‚Äôs  neighbourhood. Rainfall  also  heavily  depends  on  the  elevation  and  vegetation of  earth‚Äôs  surface  so  we  have  used  SRTM  DEM  and  AWIFS NDVI respectively. Measurements of actual rainfall are obtained from  AWS  (point  source  stations)  and  TRMM  (10km √ó 10km resolution).  First  dataset  contains  only  TIR1  band  temperature and   AWS   rainfall   data   for   training   but   the   second   dataset includes  multispectral  channel  data  and  TRMM  rainfall  data which brought about great improvement in results. For each data- set, a comparison between MLP and LSTM models is discussed here.  We  were  able  to  classify  the  rainfall  into  nil  (0mm),  low ( < 2mm),  medium  ( > = 2mm  and < 5mm)  and  high  ( > = 5  mm) with a high accuracy. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and fscore have been computed to get better insights about the dataset and  its  corresponding  outcome.  Our  results  show  that  LSTM performs  significantly  better  than  MLP  for  any  given  balanced class  data-sets.",,11

The database includes both real-measured data, and simulated time-delay data, as well as ground-truth client position information, which can be used for validation and performance analysis. The PE code is designed to process the database data format and produce estimates of the mobile WiFi receiver position within the indoor venue.  The database may be used for the development, validation and performance analysis of additional positioning engines.  This kind of WiFi client PE enables an unlimited number of clients to estimate the position and navigate within the Wi-Fi network coverage area. Hence, it enables so-called ""Wi-Fi Scalable Location"".  A *.pdf whitepaper is included in the repository and explains the functionality and usage of the code and database.",,9

Correlation plots were created for the daily percentage return and Closing prices of the stocks to check how correlated two stocks are. It was obvious that all technology stocks are positively correlated but few like Amazon and Microsoft were highly correlated with each other. The information gathered on daily percentage returns was further used for Risk Analysis by calculating the Expected Return (Average / mean return of the stock) and standard deviation (measurement of Risk -> Greater the std. dev. greater is the risk and vice versa). A scatter plot was created for comparing the Expected return of stocks to its risk. This helped in visualizing the risk factor of various stocks (stocks with high standard deviation and low return).",,8

The proposed methodology uses standard deviation of pre-defined block of DCT coefficient as feature vector. In this way single image is converted into feature vector of 1 x 39. Recognition process is being done by performing distance measurement between feature vector of testing and training data set. Results show that the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of feature level fusion is less than that of uni-modal systems, hence having multimodality is advantageous. Testing and training is done on database of 500 students of College of Engineering Pune, Pune, India. Canberra distance shows best result when compared to Euclidean or Manhatten distance. ",,7

The objectives of these measurements are to diagnose the level of Dementia in the individuals and the probability that these individuals may have Alzheimer\'s Disease (AD).  In published studies, Machine Learning has been applied to Alzheimer‚Äôs/Dementia identification from MRI scans and related data in the academic papers/theses in References 10 and 11 listed in the References Section below. Recently, a close relative of mine had to undergo a sequence of MRI tests for cognition difficulties.The motivation for choosing this topic for the Capstone project arose from the desire to understand and analyze potential for Dementia and AD from MRI related data. Cognitive testing, clinical assessments and demographic data related to these MRI tests are used in this project. This Capstone project does not use the MRI ""imaging"" data and does not focus on AD, focusses only on Dementia.  *****Conclusions, Justification, and Reflections*****  [Student adequately summarizes the end-to-end problem solution and discusses one or two particular aspects of the project they found interesting or difficult.]  The formulation of OASIS data (Ref 1 and 2) in terms of a dementia classification problem based on demographic and clinical data only (and without directly using the MRI image data), is a simplification that has major advantages and appeal. This means the trained model can classify whether an individual has dementia or not with about 87% accuracy, without having to wait for radiological interpretation of MRI scans. This can provide an early alert for intervention and initiation of treatment for those with onset of dementia.  The assumption that the combined cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets would lead to dementia label classification of acceptable accuracy came out to be true. The method required careful data cleaning and data preparation work, converting it to a binary classification problem, as outlined in this notebook.  At the outset it was not clear which algorithm(s) would be more appropriate for the binary and multi-label classification problem. The approach of spot checking the algorithms early for accuracy led to the determination of a smaller set of algorithms with higher accuracy (e.g. Gadient Boosting and Random Forest) for a deeper dive examination, e.g. use of a k-fold cross-validation approach in classifying the CDR label.  The neural network benchmark model accuracy of 78% for binary classification was exceeded by the classification accuracy of the main output of this study, the trained Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classification models. This builds confidence in the latter model for further training with new data and further classification use for new patients.",,6
