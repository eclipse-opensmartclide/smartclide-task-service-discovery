This study result suggests that the online job boards become the major channel for job seekers in the digital era. However, another finding in the study indicates that most of the job seekers fail to match their experiences with the job requirements and spend hours on job board to apply job which is not seen to be suitable (Aaron, 2015). Additionally, Dr. John Sullivan conducted a similar research in 2013 which highlighted some interesting aspects: on average, 250 resumes are received for each job opening by the major organizations, more than 50% of the resumes does not meet the minimum requirement (John, 2013). This means the time our recruiter spends on these 50% of the resumes for each job is wasted. From both candidate and recruiter’s points of view, the phenomenon may suggest that the traditional online job board does not seem to simplify the job application process or reduce the effort required from both parties. With this challenge getting bigger and bigger, the demand to automate the resume - job matching process is getting increased as well. For instance, the content - based recommendation system (CBR) is introduced to analyze the job description to identify the potential area of interest to the job seekers (Shiqiang et al., 2016). To apply the concept in Singapore local context, our team has conducted a text mining project based on the data acquired from the major online job board in Singapore. The primary objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to accelerate the job - resume matching process. The detail of the text mining methodology and results are presented in the following sections.",,48

How can we automatically extract knowledge or make sense of massive quantities of data? These are the fundamental questions of machine learning. Machine learning and data mining algorithms use techniques from statistics, optimization, and computer science to create automated systems which can sift through large volumes of data at high speed to make predictions or decisions without human intervention. Machine learning as a field is now incredibly pervasive, with applications from the web (search, advertisements, and suggestions) to national security, from analyzing biochemical interactions to traffic and emissions to astrophysics. Perhaps most famously, the $1M Netflix prize stirred up interest in learning algorithms in professionals, students, and hobbyists alike. This class will familiarize you with a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning, and prepare you for research or industry application of machine learning techniques. Background  We will assume basic familiarity with the concepts of probability and linear algebra. Some programming will be required; we will primarily use Matlab, but no prior experience with Matlab will be assumed. (Most or all code should be Octave compatible, so you may use Octave if you prefer.) Textbook and Reading  There is no required textbook for the class. However, useful books on the subject for supplementary reading include Murphy\'s ""Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"", Duda, Hart & Stork, ""Pattern Classification"", and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"".",,27

267,https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/SpreadCoin.git,"SpreadCoin October 5, 2014 Introduction In proof-of-work cryptocurrencies new coins are generated by the network through the process of mining. One of the purposes of mining is to protect network from double spending attacks and history rewriting. Miners generate new blocks and check contents of the blocks generated by other peers for conformation to the network rules. However, many miners now delegate all the checking work crucial to cryptocurrency security to pools. This means that pool operators do not have any large hashing power but have control over generation of new blocks. This brings unnecessary centralization to otherwise decentralized system. Controlling more than 50% of mining power allows to perform double-spending attacks with 100% chance of success but even with less than 50% control it is possible to perform attacks which have chances to succeed1 . The core idea of SpreadCoin is to prevent creation of pools and thus make mining more decentralized and the whole system more secure. Pool Prevention In pooled mining miners perform only the work which is necessary to fulfill the proof-of-work requirements and pools take care of block generation and broadcasting and distribute reward among miners according to the shares they submit. In this scheme miner has two alternatives: 1. Solo mining. In this case miner cannot send shares to the pool because they will not be accepted. 2. Pooled mining. Miner’s shares will be accepted by the pool but in the case miner will actually generate a new block its reward will go to the pool which will redistribute it to all miners. This allows organization of pools because miners has no way to cheat and steal generated money. To prevent creation of pools we must remove this possibility so that if pool will be created than miner can mine in a pool, submit shares as usual and get reward for them but in the case of actually finding a block miner can send it directly to the network instead of the pool and get full reward for it. In SpreadCoin mining is organized in such way that miner must know the following things: 1. Private key corresponding to the coinbase transaction. 2. Whole block, not only its header. This ensures that miner can broadcast mined block and spend coins generated in that block. It may seem that it is necessary to know only the private key to spend coinbase transaction. If two conflicting transactions will appear on the network then the one that was broadcasted first will have much higher probability to be included in a block because each peer remembers and retransmits only the first one of the conflicting transactions. If both miner and pool know private key but only pool knows the content of the block than pool can generate and broadcast spending transaction earlier than miner. If both miner  1 Double-spending. Bitcoin Wiki. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending and pool know content of the block than miner will be the first one who can broadcast block and spending transaction. To prove knowledge of the private key and whole block there are two new fields in the block header: MinerSignature and hashWholeBlock. MinerSignature is a digital signature of all fields of the block header except for the hashWholeBlock. Changing any information in the block requires regeneration of this signature which means that it is necessary to recalculate it during each iteration of the mining process. This implies that miner must be able to sign any arbitrary data. hashWholeBlock is a SHA-256 hash of the block data arranged as follows: Padding ensures that there is no incentive to mine empty blocks without transactions. Padding values are computed using simple algorithm which initializes last 32 bytes (8 uint32) with hashPrevBlock and then goes backward and computes remaining uint32 values using the following recursive formula: 𝐼𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖+3 ∙ 𝐼𝑖+7. This algorithm ensures that there is no efficient way to compute padding values on the fly during hash computation which otherwise could potentially give some advantage to mine empty blocks in certain computing environments. It is important that block is hashed twice. If it was hashed only once then pool could hash the beginning of the block and send resulting hash state to the miners. Each miner would then modify some information in the end of the block and recalculate the hash based on the known state without actual knowledge about what is contained in the beginning of the block. Appending block data to itself make it necessary to know the whole block to recalculate hashWholeBlock. Pool may detect and ban cheating miners. However, many miners may still prefer to cheat so that pool will be completely unusable for honest miners. Miners that have low probability of finding a block will get more profit by stealing reward for accidentally found block even if pool will ban them thereafter. Miners that have enough mining power to find blocks consistently can still connect to a pool and submit shares for some time but steal the first found block. This way they can get both reward for their shares and the actual mined block. Given all this it is expected that no one will create a pool. But even if someone will than it can be countered by releasing stealing miner software which many miners will switch to. Compact Transactions SpreadCoin as well as Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures. Each address in Bitcoin is a hash of an ECDSA public key. To spend coins sent to an address it is necessary to provide public key matching to that hash and a signature. This results in 139 or 107 bytes for each transaction input script (scriptSig) depending on Block Padding MAX_BLOCK_SIZE Block Padding whether compact public key is used. However, it is possible to recover public key from the signature2 which means that it is not necessary to provide it in transaction input. Together with using compact representation of the signature3 it allows to reduce size of transaction input script from 139 or 107 bytes in Bitcoin to 67 bytes in SpreadCoin. Recovering public key has almost no extra CPU cost compared to the usual signature verification process used in Bitcoin. This is important because the CPU cost of ECDSA signature verification is a bottleneck for Bitcoin transaction processing. Usual output script (scriptPubKey) in Bitcoin looks as follows: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 5bd18804e4bb43a4bb8b6bc88408970bafaf4a38 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG In SpreadCoin the semantics of the OP_CHECKSIG instruction was changed to checking signature by hash of the public key (it recovers public key and compares its hash with the provided one). This results in a much simpler script in SpreadCoin: 5bd18804e4bb43a4bb8b6bc88408970bafaf4a38 OP_CHECKSIG This results in additional minor space saving because this script is 3 bytes smaller. Smooth Supply Block reward in Bitcoin is computed using the following formula: 𝑅ℎ = 𝑅0 ∙ 2 −⌊ ℎ 𝑝 ⌋ , where ℎ – block height, 𝑝 – reward halving period, 𝑅0 – initial reward, 𝑅ℎ – reward for block ℎ, ⌊ ⌋ – floor function. This method results in abrupt reward changes near halving points. SpreadCoin uses simple linear interpolation between halving points to make reward decrease much smother. This is achieved by modifying reward using the following formula: 𝑅ℎ ′ = 4 3 (𝑅ℎ − 𝑅ℎ ∙ ℎ mod 𝑝 2𝑝 ). SpreadCoin uses 𝑝 = 2 ∙ 106 as its reward halving period.  2 ECDSA Signatures allow recovery of the public key. Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6430.0%29%3F 3 Why the signature is always 65 (1+32+32) bytes long? Bitcoin Stack Exchange. https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/12554/why-the-signature-is-always-65-13232-bytes-long | NO YEAR 2106 PROBLEM The time stamp field in the block header is now 64 bit instead of 32 bit (Bitcoin) so that much farther date times are possible (>Year 2106) Upcoming features that are in development and will be introduced over the next weeks and months: SERVICENODES A servicenode is a node which runs continuously (24/7) on a server and which provides services within the spreadcoin network.  You have to pay a collateral to be able to install a servernode (in return your servicenode will earn a steady income).   This collateral is determined by a free market price discovery.  (No fix collateral. The price is allowed to fluctuate over time.) COMPETITIVE COLLATERAL Furthermore, to introduce a competitive nature to the servicenodes there will only ever be a limited number of allowed servicenodes worldwide.  Since the collateral isn\'t set in stone, but the amount of servicenodes is fixed, the price of a servicenode will be determined by the participants themselves.  It is expected that the price will vary widely over time, which exposes it to the same market forces that hashrate and currency value are exposed to too. SERVICE APPS There are a number of decentralized applications that will run on servicenodes.  Most likely those apps will include:  1) ""Spread the message"" (an in-wallet encrypted messaging system, which allows you to send a message to an SPR address)  2) ""Spread the Search"" (A decentralized search engine that lets the servicenodes crawl and map the entire internet.)  . SPREADX11 SpreadX11 is different from plain X11 by introducing a sophisticated pool prevention mechanism.  With SpreadX11 every block header contains additional information (MinerSignature and hashWholeBlock). With the help of this information the protocol ensures that the miner of a new block is always also the first one to know the content of the whole block and the private key to spend the coinbase transaction. (contrary to pool mining where the pool operator is the first one to know those things)  So when a miner finds a block, he must himself sign and transmit the block to the network (like solo mining), instead of having a pool handle this for him.  This effectively prevents pools by making their rules non-enforceable, since any miner in any assumed pool can always just steal the block reward instead of following the rules set up by the pool. COMPACT TRANSACTIONS SpreadCoin uses a more compact representation for signatures in transactions.  SpreadCoin as well as Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures. While bitcoin keeps a copy of the public key of the corresponding signature around, SpreadCoin ommits this by recovering the public key on the fly directly from the signature.  This way it is not necessary to keep the public key of every ECDSA signature in the blockchain, so this leads to *smaller transactions and hence a smaller blockchain (at the cost of a few CPU cycles more).  (*reduction in size of transaction from 139 or 107 bytes in Bitcoin to 67 bytes in SpreadCoin.) SMOOTH HALVING Unlike Bitcoin, there are no abrupt reward halvings in SpreadCoin. Block reward is smoothly decreasing over time. UNIQUE DESIGN WITH IN-WALLET VANITYGEN One of the first apps to be built into the wallet is the vanity generator (or vanity gen) which allows anyone to create personalised payment addresses.  The easy to use wallet lets you search through trillions of payment addresses allowing you to find one or multiple vanity addresses, which are then stored safely along with the private keys on your own computer - and nowhere else.  Searching using the vanity gen is probabilistic, so the amount of time required to find your chosen address patterns depends on how complex the pattern is, the speed of your computer, and a little bit of luck.  You can use the vanity gen for a bit of fun, to make your address standout from the crowd or to create a link to a brand, business or other organisation. You can even search for addresses that others might be willing to buy from you. SpreadCoin is a new cryptocurrency which is more decentralized than Bitcoin. It prevents centralization of hashing power in pools, which is one of the main concerns of Bitcoin security. SpreadCoin was fairly launched on 29 July 2014, 9:00 UTC with no premine. ",,12

Using the simulation program to generate the geological data of the experiment, in the process of experiment, found a way to use R tree indexing can significantly speed up the generating spatial transaction set, at the same time, choose the more classic Apriori algorithm and FP - growth algorithm contrast performance, results show that the FP - growth algorithm is much faster than the Apriori algorithm, analyses the main reasons why the Apriori algorithm to generate a large number of candidate itemsets.In this paper, the main work is as follows: (1) In order to speed up the neighborhood search, choose to establish R tree spatial index, on the basis of summarizing the common scenarios to apply spatial indexing technology and the advantages and disadvantages. (2) Based on the analysis of traditional association rule mining algorithm and spatial association rule mining algorithm on the basis of the model based on event center space with pattern mining algorithm was described, and puts forward with a rule mining algorithm based on raster scanning, the algorithm by scanning for the center with a grid of R - neighborhood affairs set grid, will study data mining into the traditional data mining algorithm. (3) In the process of spatial index R tree insert, in order to prevent insertion to split after the leaf node, leading to a recursive has been split up destroy the one-way traverse, is put forward in the process of looking for insert position that records if full node number is M (M number) for each node up to insert nodes, first to divide to avoid after layers of recursive splitting up, speed up the R tree insertion efficiency. (4) On the basis of spatial transaction set preprocessing, realize the Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm two kinds of classic association rule mining algorithm, performance contrast analysis.",,9

It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (# of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files & instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet   - (Tests) Fix valgrind errors   - (Tests) Use local directory for blockchain instead of default directory   - (Tests) Run tests on Windows if using new enough MSVC  LINKS: Windows 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4kubwwnb4t7o4w/pebblecoin-all-win32-x64-v0.4.4.1.zip?dl=0 Mac 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoy9z1oxu4x53cv/pebblecoin-all-mac-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0 Linux 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq3h3bc29jmndks/pebblecoin-all-linux-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0  Exchange: https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_xpb .  Source: https://github.com/xpbcreator/pebblecoin/  CONTACT: xpbcreator@torguard.tg IRC: irc.freenode.net, #pebblecoin   UPDATE 2015/06/08: Version 0.4.3.1 is now out.  This is a minor, mostly bug-fix release.  Work continues on the next major release which will bring us user-created currencies and user-graded contracts. Release notes: Code: Release Notes 0.4.3.1 - RPC calls for DPOS:   - getdelegateinfos RPC call   - get kimageseqs RPC call   - block header contains signing_delegate_id - fix checkpoint rollback bug - fix inability to send coins if voting history was lost   UPDATE 2015/05/04: Version 0.4.2.2 is now out.  This is a bug-fix/cosmetic release.  Release notes: Payment ID support Windows installer Logos updated Improved DPOS tab Sync issues fully fixed Fix rare crash bug Fix min out 0 bug Fix debit display Fix GUI not updating Updated hard-coded seed nodes   UPDATE 2015/04/24: The switch-over to DPOS has succeeded without a hitch!  DPOS blocks are being signed as we speak, at the far faster pace of 15 seconds per block.  This marks the start of a new era for Pebblecoin.   UPDATE 2015/04/21: Congratulations to the first registered delegate!  This indicates the start of the forking change so everybody please update your daemons if you haven't already.    To promote the coin and encourage people to become delegates, we've come up with an incentive scheme.  First, we'll send a free 100 XPB to anybody who PMs me their public address, for people to play around with and to start using the coin.  Second, once DPOS starts, for the first month of DPOS I'll send an extra 0.5 XPB to the signing delegate for every block they process.  This is on top of the usual transaction fees they will receive.  This is to encourage more people to become delegates at this important phase of the coin.   UPDATE 2015/04/19: All went well on the testnet release, so after a few further minor modifications, we are releasing version 0.4.1.2 to the public.  This is a forking change, so please update your clients and servers (links below).  At block 83120, sometime on April 21st, registration for DPOS delegates will begin.  At block 85300, sometime on April 24th, the network will switch over to DPOS.  As with the testnet, to become a delegate and receive block fees for securing the network, just turn on your wallet, register to be a delegate (5 XPB fee), and then leave your wallet on.  It will sign the blocks when it is your turn.  While Roman works on the next phase of the release - introducing subcurrencies - I will be fixing up some loose ends on the wallet, adding payment ID support, etc.  This is truly an exciting time for Pebblecoin.  RELEASE NOTES: All clients adjust internal clocks using ntp (client list in src/common/ntp_time.cpp) Added testnet support DPOS registration starts Block 83120 (~April 21st) DPOS phase starts Block 85300 (~April 24th) Default fee bumped to 0.10 XPB Low-free transactions no longer get relayed by default Significantly improved wallet sync Checkpoint at Block 79000   TOTAL CURRENT COINS: Available at this link. BLOCK TARGET TIME: 2 minutes EXPECTED EMISSION: At Block 3600 (End of Day 5): ~78 XPBs At Block 6480 (End of Day 9): ~758 XPBs At Block 9360 (End of Day 13): 6,771.0 XPBs At Block 12240 (End of Day 17): ~61,000 XPBs At Block 15120 (End of Day 21): ~550,000 XPBs, start of regular 300/block emission At Block 21900 (End of Month 1): ~2,600,000 XPBs, 300/block At Block 43800 (End of Month 2): ~9,150,000 XPBs, 300/block At Block 85300 (End of POW phase): ~21,500,300 XPBs.   UPDATE: The Pebblecoin Pool is now live!   Instructions: Download the linux miner and run it: ./minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x   UPDATE: The Pebblecoin wallet is now live!     There have been thousands of attempts at alternative currencies in the community.  Many are 100% copies of existing blockchains with a different name.  Some are very slight variations with no significant differences.  From recent history it is apparent the only realistic chance for viability of a new currency is one that is innovation and continued support and development.  The bitcoin community for good reason has shown interest in currencies that provide privacy of transactions, several currencies such as darkcoin, have become popular based on this desire.  The best technology for privacy is cryptonote although for a variety of reasons there hasnt been much development for ease of use, and as a result there has not been significant adoption.  Pebblecoin (XPB) is a cryptonote based coin with improvements and changes in some areas, and the promise of development in others.  I invite developers to work on this technology with me.  There is no premine, any tips or support of any developer including myself will be completely voluntary.  These are the following areas which I have determined needs changes/updates: I welcome suggestions, and am interested what else I can try to improve.  1) New Mining algorithm (active)  A mining algorithm is either susceptible to ASIC development or to being botnetted, meaning it is either more efficient to have a centralized mining entity (as is the case with bitcoin) or to have an algorithm that requires a real CPU, in which case botnets become very attractive.  To my knowledge there does not exist a blockchain that attempts to solve both problems, by having an algorithm that only works on a general purpose computer and is difficult to botnet.  Cryptonote coins currently are primarily mined with botnets.  Boulderhash is a new mining algorithm requiring 13 GB RAM, nearly eliminating all possible zombie (botnet controlled) computers from mining.  Most infected computers in the world do not have 13 GB available, so an algorithm that requires that much RAM severely limits the productivity of a botnet.  13 GB also makes ASICs cost prohibitive, and the current GPUs do not have that much RAM.  What's left is general purpose computers as was the original intent of bitcoin's mining process.  2) Distribution of coins (active)  It is very common in the launch of a new cryptocurrency the distribution algorithm heavily is weighted towards the very early adopters.  Such distribution is designed to give a massive advantage to people who are fully prepared to mine at launch, with a very large difference shortly after sometimes a few days later.  If the point of mining is to both secure the network and fairly distribute coins a gradual build up of rewards makes more sense, with no drop off in mining rewards.  At a standard block reward of 300, at launch each block will reward 0.3 coins leading up to 3, 30, and finally the standard reward of 300 which will be the standard unchanging reward from that point.  It will take approximately 3 weeks for the block reward of 300 to be reached.  3) GUI Software (active)  There are no current cryptonote coins that have a downloadable GUI, which makes the user experience much worse than that of bitcoin.  It is hard to achieve signficant adoption with a command line interface.  The very first update had the exact GUI written for bitcoin fully working with Pebblecoin.  The GUI was released on Jan 19, before the full 300 XPB reward was awarded for winning the block.  4) IRC Chat support embedded in Client GUI (active)  For user support, and to talk to core developers message boards such as Bitcointalk and reddit are primarily used.  I have embedded an IRC client in the GUI and be available at set hours for any kind of support.   5) Address aliasing (to be worked on)  Just as a user visiting google does not need to know the ip address, similarly an address should have the ability to have an associated userid.  If I ask a friend to send me pebblecoins it would be easier to tell him send it to @myuserid rather than a very long address or scanning a QR code.  There should be a way of registering a userid on the blockchain that will permanently translate to a pebblecoin addresss.   QT INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package for your respective platform Run the Qt executable.  The software will generate a new wallet for you and use a default folder: ~/.pebblecoin on Linux and %appdata%\\pebblecoin on Windows. To use an existing wallet, copy the wallet.keys file into the default folder. To use a different data directory and/or wallet file, run the software like so: ./pebblecoin-qt --data-dir <DataDir> --wallet-file <FileName>. To enable mining, run the start_mining_NEEDS_13GB_RAM.bat batch file. Or run the qt wallet with the --enable-boulderhash command line option, or put enable-boulderhash=1 into the config file.  It will start mining to the wallet address.  To change the number of mining threads (13GB required per thread), do --mining-threads <NumThreads> or edit the batch file.  DAEMON + SIMPLEWALLET INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package, run: ./pebblecoind --data-dir pebblecoin_data Once the daemon finished syncing, run the simplewallet: ./simplewallet  POOL INSTRUCTIONS: Download the miner binary for your platform. Run the miner using a wallet address gotten from simplewallet or the Qt Wallet:  Code: minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x [/li]   DEV WALLET (for donations): PByFqCfuDRUPVsNrzrUXnuUdF7LpXsTTZXeq5cdHpJDogbJ8EBXopciN7DmQiGhLEo5ArA7dFqGga2A AhbRaZ2gL8jjp9VmYgk""}",,6

You can uncheck the web development tools and SQL tools since you won\'t use them for building AEON.   This will take time to download and install and you will have to reboot upon completion. - Download and install cMake for windows from : http://www.cmake.org/download/ (Win32 install) - Download Boost 1.57 from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ , use the zip or 7zip archive and extract.   You can use c:\\boost_1_57_0 since this is what I am using for this steps. - Download and install Github for Windows from https://windows.github.com/ (This also includes a Git shell that we will use later).  Now the nasty part compile & build time ! - Build Boost :   Open a command line and type : Code:  > cd c:\\boost_1_57_0   > bootstrap.bat   > b2 --toolset=msvc variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static address-model=64 - Open the Git Shell (or Git bash) depending what you downloaded previously and do. Code:  > git clone https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.git   > cd aeon   > mkdir build   > cd build   > cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12 Win64"" -DBOOST_ROOT=c:\\boost_1_57_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=c:\\boost_1_57_0\\stage\\lib ..   > MSBuild Project.sln /p:Configuration=release /m    You should now find the exe files under build/src/release . Aeon isn\'t a cryptocurrency. It\'s a lifestyle. It\'s about polished perfection, attained by breaking the rules with calculated mastery of the art. It\'s about respecting history and pushing innovation forward at the same time. It\'s about more than just math: it\'s a vision of a world where luxury is the same as entry-level, and the limits are the heavens themselves. If you\'re just buying Aeon to get rich, don\'t even bother. Aeon needs more than just the next wave of crypto speculators: we\'re looking for the truly elite. But if you think you have what it takes to redefine global finance and discover new magnitudes of wealth in the process... Well, Aeon is ready for you. Are you ready for Aeon? ",,5

There has been a significant increase in the number of customers experiencing credit card fraud over the last few months. A major news outlet even recently published a story about the credit card fraud you and other banks are experiencing.   As a response to this situation, you have been tasked to solve part of this problem by leveraging machine learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions before they have a larger impact on your company. You have been given access to a dataset of past credit card transactions, which you can use to train a machine learning model to predict if transactions are fraudulent or not.    ## About this dataset The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred over the course of two days and includes examples of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  ### Features The dataset contains over 30 numerical features, most of which have undergone principal component analysis (PCA) transformations because of personal privacy issues with the data. The only features that have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. The feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction amount. 'Class' is the response or target variable, and it takes a value of '1' in cases of fraud and '0' otherwise.  Features:  `V1, V2, ... V28`: Principal components obtained with PCA  Non-PCA features: - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, $T_x - t_0$ - `Amount`: Transaction amount; this feature can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning  - `Class`: Target variable where `Fraud = 1` and `Not Fraud = 0`  ### Dataset attributions Website: https://www.openml.org/d/1597  Twitter: https://twitter.com/dalpozz/status/645542397569593344  Authors: Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, and Gianluca Bontempi Source: Credit card fraud detection - June 25, 2015 Official citation: Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A.

623,https://github.com/chankwpj/CUROP2016.git,"{""Automatic Analysis of Music Performance Style  One fundamental problem in computational music is analysis and modeling of performance style. Last year’s successful CUROP project revealed, through perceptual experiments, that players' control over rhythm is the strongest factor in the perceived quality of performance (already a publishable result). This year's project will hence investigate the computer analysis of the rhythmic component of performances in more detail, with the following aims:  Implement and improve upon state-of-the-art beat detection methods. Carry out statistical analysis of rhythmic variation on a corpus of performances: Train a classifier into professional/amateur performance. Investigate to what extent rhythmic variations are controlled as opposed to random. Devise rhythmic style signatures of various performers for style recognition and retrieval. Investigate operations on rhythmic styles, e.g. apply Rachmaninoff's style to one's amateur recording. Solving the above problems is paramount to our understanding of what makes a good performance and what, quantitatively, are the differences between professional musician's styles. Applications include: musicology, teaching, automatic performance of music, high-level editing of music.  This project requires integration of data mining, machine learning, and digital signal processing techniques, which are closely aligned with the expertise of the two supervisors: Dr Kirill Sidorov and Dr Andrew Jones. who are also experienced musicians.  Via this project, the student will learn a variety of digital signal processing and machine learning techniques and will develop enhanced MATLAB programming skills, that are increasingly in demand for graduates.  The student will work in our lab, with state-of-the-art facilities (powerful audio workstation, digital piano, audio gear). We will work collaboratively to ensure successful completion, including daily 30 minute meetings and longer weekly review meetings. The student will participate in the recently established Computational Music research sub-group. This project will contribute to longer-term development of this sub-group and foster new research avenues.  Project Start/End Dates: Any 8 week period from 13th June 2016 to September 19th 2016.
