Time windows may be hard or soft. In case of hard time windows, a vehicle that arrives too early at a customer must wait until the customer is ready to begin service. In general, waiting before the start of a time window incurs no cost. In the case of soft time windows, every time window can be violated barring a penalty cost. The time windows may be one-sided, e.g., stated as the latest time for delivery. Time windows arise naturally in problems faced by business organizations which work on flexible time schedules. Specific problems with hard time windows include security patrol service, bank deliveries, postal deliveries, industrial refuse collection, grocery delivery, school bus routing, and urban newspaper distribution. Among the soft time window problems, dial-a-ride problems constitute an important example.",,5

Firstly, the task mandates the recognition of an extremely high number of different items, in the order of several thousand for medium-small shops, with many of them featuring small inter and intra class variability. Then, available product databases usually include just one or a few studio-quality images per product (referred to herein as reference images), whilst at test time recognition is performed on pictures displaying a portion of a shelf containing several products and taken in the store by cheap cameras (referred to as query images). Moreover, as the items on sale in a store as well as their appearance change frequently over time, a practical recognition system should handle seamlessly new products/packages. Inspired by recent advances in object detection and image retrieval, we propose to leverage on state-of-the-art image classification based on deep learning. In the study conducted our objective is to use this technology to help blind people around the world, which will help them to shop easily to identity the grocery product on the shelves. For image classification various CNN based image classification algorithms have been applied in this study. Our system is computationally expensive at training time but can perform recognition rapidly and accurately at test time.",,2
