31,https://github.com/mxk180040/Airbnb-Rental-Listings-for-San-Francisco.git,"Airbnb is a privately-owned accommodation rental website which allows house owners to rent out their properties to guests looking for a place to stay. Airbnb enables a marketplace where people can rent lodging in residential properties. The main idea is a house-sharing service that offers an opportunity for travellers to get cheaper accommodation wherever they travel to. As of 15 September 2019, hosts have earned more than $80bn sharing their homes and spaces on Airbnb. The offers range from shared rooms to full condos/houses and can offer unique and differentiated options as compared to normal traditional hotels. Airbnb has 31 offices across the world and have hosted 400 million guests since its launch. Opportunity for homeowners to make more money from their homes by sharing with travellers. Airbnb offers complete independence to its hosts to decide on the price for their properties, however with only minimal attributes to leverage upon and compare similar previous listings in their neighbourhood, the hosts find it difficult to come up with a competitive price. With the number of hosts using Airbnb increasing, coming up with the right price to remain competitive in a host‚Äôs neighbourhood is important. On the other side, guests can also find places to stay at a reasonable price and understand the seasonal demands. Airbnb has also seen a potential growth with the number of rentals/listings in its website subsequently increasing each year. Through our analysis, we want to address the following: ‚Ä¢ What time of the year are Airbnb‚Äôs most popular in San Francisco? Are specific holiday seasons more popular? ‚Ä¢ What are the most important characteristics of a listing, and how do they influence price? ‚Ä¢ Understand the rental landscape in San Francisco through various static and interactive visualisations. ‚Ä¢ How fast is Airbnb growing in San Francisco? ‚Ä¢ The exploration results could refer useful knowledge for hosts who search for comparable price and make their listing stand out. ‚Ä¢ Predict the Airbnb Listing Price in San Francisco ‚Ä¢ We wanted to do a project that addresses a common issue that could either benefit an organization or the general public. The challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. ‚Ä¢ Since Airbnb is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace. ‚Ä¢ Moreover, we wanted to pick a dataset that gives us some scope to perform various analysis.

34,https://github.com/concorde-speed/Concorde.git,"Date of Concorde In January of the year 1976 after 29 years of the first to penetrate to the speed of sound military aircraft jet - Two Concord took off together at the same time, one from London and one from Paris, the first airline service ultrasound for travelers. The aircraft Almottaghtan has looked towards the west as if they were Tgaraan - even Tsabakan - the sun. Where they arrived as if they did not Taathrca, in terms of time, in a new event launches air transport stage supersonic passenger wealthy people who do not allow them to narrow their time to stay in the air for long periods. How the project began and evolved, and how the outcome of the remaining Concorde lounges to museums ... This is what Santapah in the following lines: The emergence of the Concorde The deal ""supersonic"" between England and France was signed in 1962, for the design and construction of the first civilian supersonic plane manufactured by Airbus for them. After long years of arduous efforts and research strenuous, in addition to more than 5,000 hours in the air tunnels, proved to be a form of equity Almstrq with the body long cylinder for aircraft relatively large passengers, it is the best form executable command and control speeds ultrasound. The first two aircraft of this type making and Tjeribhma in 1969, and since then about 20 aircraft of this model, called the ""Concord"" was produced (the only civilian aircraft that exceed the speed of sound speed), and who serve in the British Airways and Air France in income 1976, the rate of seven aircraft of the British lines and five lines in French. The first fly line is the London - Singapore via Bahrain. In 1976 received Bahrain Airport very important event, which is to start regular flights between Bahrain and London, the fastest of the British Airways sound Concorde, the airport first and the only one who was receiving this type of aircraft in the Middle East, given that the Concorde need to Airports women with special specifications, so they need to take-off and landing runways longer than the regular airports runways, and the noise from the power of their engines leads to smash windows of buildings ordinary airports, and the speed has a crush Madarjha. What Concorde is distinct from other aircraft?Characterized by Concorde slim form in the form of a triangle (delta). And fly faster and higher than other aircraft altitudes, using the ""upward vortex"" method to accomplish extraordinary mission. For example, while the ""Boeing 747"" aircraft speed, better known as ""jumbo"" around 900 km / h (about 84.0 Mach) at an altitude of 35 thousand feet, the Concorde fly quickly 2172 km / h (Mach 2) at an altitude of 60 thousand Foot. It is known that Almaj is the real rate of speed compared to the speed of sound, and is equivalent to an average of 1225 kilometers per hour, so that the speed of sound changes with temperature change, which moves rapidly 1190 km / h at sea level, but it drops to 1060 km / h at an altitude of 36,000 feet above the ground, where the air temperature drops. Because the Place de la Concorde to fly faster than the speed of sound, they differ from the rest of the aircraft on several characteristics. First, in terms of the flow of the fuselage, where you need to own dynamic shape to face severe air resistance at these high speeds, and it is achieved by taking the body form of a high pin tapered, triangular wings tilted back, my head and a tail, and an introduction brushes can be moved to the bottom of takeoffs and landings to be able to see the pilot of the corridor, to the top during flight to improve the flow of the fuselage. Amounting to 83 feet and 8 inches tall plane wings in the company ""Oarossbesiak"" has produced and supplied surfaces work together Kdvh depth, also works differentially Kjnahat. There is no tip installed inside the concavity of the wing, but no spire parties descend and spin at the same time. The second difference is related engines, where the Concorde\'s engines proved directly in the wings to avoid the use of any parts of the conductive would crash at high speeds, and the engine fitted with a special friendly hotel to exploit the resulting exhaust for initial combustion cycle combustion again mixing with more new fuel to increase efficient engines and power, where this process provides the engine in the final stage of heating fuel for the production of the required additional power for takeoff and the transition from one phase to the heating of supersonic flight, allowing aircraft takeoff speed of 360 km / h. The useful load carried by the Concorde\'s less than a third of what was done other than in the weight of the jets under the sound, so it was no reduction in the efficiency of the engine, it is actually the difference between profit and loss. Every Concorde has supplied four-engine aircraft, ""Snecma Olympus DS 593,"" the momentum of 17259 kg. The company ""Rolls Royce"" design engines, which provided all Dagtin separate engine in order to fuel economy. Each engine and also provided additional Aq. Engine reverse payment system is also equipped. On the other hand, the Concorde is distinct from other aircraft fuel tanks and the presence of more and larger, with four engines burn a tremendous amount of kerosene has more than 25 thousand liters per flight hour. However, the fuel tanks lead a purpose whatever else, which is to maintain the equilibrium plane, where the center to raise the plane travels at high speeds for its center of gravity and then you move amounts of fuel between private additional tanks at the front of the plane and the rear to offset that effect, and returned those quantities at low speed in preparation for landing to bring the situation back to its origin. For example, a flight plan requires the distance between Paris and the French coast on the Atlantic equator at less than the speed of sound speed is determined to 0.93 Mach, to be at the height of about 9000 meters, after which the plane begins to jump quickly to reach the speed of take-off and altitude wanted, it performs speed between the two situations difference to a change in the dynamics of the plane to move from the airline less than the sound quickly to other higher speed of sound, and to overcome this situation, the transfer of fuel in an aircraft using a payment of reservoirs located in the introduction to the reservoirs in the system rear. During the transitional situation between the two modes of ex (between Mach 1 and Mach 1.6) increases air resistance sharply, and at this moment is to break the sound barrier. Once access to 1.7 Mach the captain to stop the internal combustion process, after more than a very plane speed of up to Mach 2, or 2200 km / h, more than twice the speed of sound, which represent the target aircraft speed, while the estimated target of 16000 and 18000 meters altitude. But when approaching landing, the fuel will move to the front of the plane, and the concomitant rise in the plane\'s nose, to land the plane in a scene it looks like a bird landing on the surface of the water. Finally remains the difference in the fuselage coating, where the Concorde is exposed at high speeds to a very large rise in body temperature as a result of increased friction of air molecules, so they coated special material properties and reflective stronger than those in the other aircraft, capable of dispersing such high temperatures . The fuselage itself is made from a special metal is characterized by a greater capacity to withstand the heat and stress resistance resulting from inflation fuselage resulting in turn from high temperature. The speed of the plane have been identified in the horizontal flight Mach 2.2, which is just before the thermal barrier (which is the speed at which if exceeded temperature increases dramatically), but it has identified the chronological age of the structure of 60,000 flight hours. And making the structure of the aluminum-alloy steel by thermal changes from -35 degrees to +120 degrees, as the flight above the speed limit of the plane requires that the structure is made with a mixture of steel and titanium, which means more weight. Fly the Concorde at the highest altitudes of 50,000 feet, where the air is equal to a tenth of what Tsawiyeh at sea density, and the temperature at that very low altitude, and despite all this work ultrasonic motors with high efficiency. According to reports of the pilots can handle the plane easily. The acceleration of the aircraft and transit speeds TransitionAnd what is characterized travel Balkounkord from other aircraft? Accommodate the Concorde for a hundred passengers and crew consists of a pilot and a flight engineer and his assistant in addition to the six hosts. When quitting, the passenger feels strongly pay back as a result of the launch aircraft from sleep to the speed of 362 km / h in just 30 seconds, which is called the Earth\'s gravitational force, and quickly reach the maximum height of the plane and penetrate the speed of the sound barrier. In all the flight times travelers can know the speed, through a private display panel installed in front of them, and are entitled to see the curve of the globe and Northern Lights because of the high altitude, which is flying the plane. Travelers can also watch the first layer colors of the atmosphere, where the height of the plane boundary between the first two Tbaktah. It takes Atlantic crossing Balkounkord three and a half hours only, while the that time about nine hours in the other underneath the aircraft sounds. And up the Concorde passengers who starts his journey from London at ten thirty in the morning to New York at nine thirty in the morning, before the date of its launch radios. This of course does not mean a retreat in time, but due to time differences and the short flight time! Over the last quarter-century, Concorde was the five weekly flights between Paris and New York in a record speed of less than 4 hours, at which time it cut the best of conventional aircraft, the same distance in 8 hours. He was landing at Kennedy Airport (according to US time) at eight in the morning, and exiting back to France at the eleventh hour before noon, where businessmen French used to negotiate with the Americans their customers at the airport Salons, without having to go to the business and financial district in Manhattan, and then return to Paris the same day.  And to what the fate of the Concorde? I tried both the US and Soviet governments (former) develop similar Balkounkord aircraft, but those attempts ended in retreat, either because the magnitude of the required expenditures on the American side, or the occurrence of accidents due to human error on the Soviet side. Some of these Soviet aircraft had stayed (model ""T U-144""), as amended to date, but used in air mail services, also placed some of them in museums, while one of them devoted to project Russian joint US. And remained the Concorde, solo travel of passengers faster than the speed of sound even temporarily suspended service to make adjustments after the accident led to an explosion killed one of them and all of them were. In addition, the high run that made the ticket price between Paris, London and New York round-trip $ 10,000, which led to limited use of the rich and famous costs, as well as what caused the noise and pollution, suffered Concorde most suffered from weak passenger demand for flights, in Following the incident, which came under the air France one in Paris in July 2000 to a near Charles de Gaulle airport hotels, which led to the deaths of 109 people on board and four people on the ground. Consequently After some major attended by experts and investigators, scientists, lawyers, artists, religious leaders and industrialists from different generations, between believers technology and Muslims in terms of authority to the modern age and among those who believe that it is necessary to rein in scientific progress and the development of ethical and legal controls him, took the final decision to stop flights Place de la Concorde. In July of 2003, tens of thousands of lovers of the Concorde gathered along the road to Heathrow Airport in the fog of London, the capital, in a bid farewell final before this model withdraw aircraft from service, after it made its first commercial flight in 1976. This has three Concorde planes reviewing the air before landing at Heathrow Airport in a reference to the termination of commercial flights known aircraft at supersonic speed. And charged the British Airways Concorde plane carrying 100 special guest at the final flight, which launched from Kennedy Airport in New York towards London, penetrated the sound barrier for the last time. Upon entering British airspace acceded Two Concord British Airways, one coming from the city of Edinburgh in Scotland, and the other from the Bay of Biscay west of France. Lovers plane Odalla in July of 2003 in Paris, as well as a pool, in the last trip out between Paris and New York, after a 27-year-old was cut where the distance between the two cities in a matter of three hours and a half. Where he lined up more than 250 workers from the maintenance workers bodyguards honor of the plane at Charles de Gaulle airport, with thousands of French gathered on the edge of the airport to see the plane taking off, holding a banner reading ""We love you, Concord."" The French lines: that the plane Concorde belong to the humanitarian aviation heritage and must therefore provide an opportunity for more people to see it, and added that it would apply to all of the fleet of Air France Concorde aircraft, which will be displayed every aircraft in museums in France, Germany and the United States, such as the Museum aviation and aerospace in the suburb of ""Le Bourget"" Paris, the Museum of Aviation near the Scottish capital ""Edinburgh"". Parts of the plane crashed as sold at Christie\'s for souvenirs to those who died to travel out, varied between the nose of the plane and the door of cabin leadership and a seat pilot and antenna radar warning in which the two motors of the engines and parts of the dashboard to the instructions and cutlery dishwasher ceramic spoons and silver booklet, worth total amounted to 3.29 million euros, went in favor of a charitable institution of the air France is working in the field of care for the poor children. Last auction for the sale of pieces of a British Airways Concorde has also been established. The British and French companies have announced at the beginning of the month of April of the same year 2003, he stopped Concorde flights after the company ""Airbus"" that produced externa announced: What\'s next in the field of transport ultrasonic? American company, ""Boeing"" is currently working on the supersonic jet, is supposed to be placed in service during the coming years, while filling the attention of European rival, ""Airbus"" accomplish its flagship aircraft, ""Airbus A380 (superjumbo) capable of carrying about 800 passengers, which had been achieved in 2007, while scientists tried to Japanese to develop a model of the plane was enable fly twice as fast as the Concorde, but their experience after the plane landed long model briefly after take-off from the site ""Woomera"" to launch rockets in the desert south of Australia, and it failed within the project included my company, ""Mitsubishi heavy Industries"" and ""Nissan Motor."" He held this paradigm of a length of 11 meters on a rocket, Plans for him to be separated from the booster rocket above the ground, and falling faster than twice the speed of sound, but it got out of control since it was launched. It was supposed to reach the aircraft remotely piloted altitude of 20 thousand meters, before Taud.aly ground faster than twice the speed of sound. The goal was to become a plane ""NeXT 1"" transport aircraft the fastest in the world to succeed Concorde, with the difference that it will be less noise and damaging to the environment and can accommodate up to 300 passengers: Thus crossed another Concorde SST recent trip mounted aboard a ship in the River Thames sailing from London to the Museum of Flight in Edinburgh, after he has made more than eight thousand flight during which 22 thousand and 768 hours and 56 cut-minute flight, the folded thereby separating mythic unique and important commercial aviation history, a supersonic flight, waiting for what the future holds for us of new inventions ?!",,2

This paper discusses a guidance module for trajectory generation of such vehicles. An offline algorithm is developed using a navigation model to produce the required trajectory in the form of time-tagged longitude, latitude and altitude. The process is an essential requirement when an operator has to program a robotic vehicle to travel on the desired course. This problem is addressed scarcely in the relevant literature. The waypoints are generated for all phases of flight and then modified to cater for the wind disturbance parameters obtained from current meteorological information. The waypoints are uploaded to the vehicle‚Äôs flight control system memory and reside there for the vehicle to follow. This paper also renders the generated trajectory on Google Earth¬Æ using Matlab/Simulink¬Æ to test the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, a Dryden wind model is utilized to generate a modified trajectory for turbulent conditions. An operator can make adjustments in the required initial heading angle so the vehicle lands at its destination even in turbulent weather. An empirical formula is also proposed for this purpose. Further work includes design of a control system to follow the generated waypoints.",,2

83,https://github.com/micgonzalez/DSC640-Summer-2020-Course-Project.git,"{""Project Information  During the course, you will be working on a 5 small data visualization projects. You will be given a scenario and a dataset ‚Äì you have the choice of using the provided dataset and scenario or coming up with your own scenario and dataset and fulfilling the requirements for each phase of the assignment ‚Äì if you choose your own scenario, it needs to be approved by your Professor in Weeks 1 & 2. Over the course of 10 weeks you will submit:      Dashboard (Weeks 1 & 2)     Executive Summary (Weeks 3 & 4)     Blog Post (Weeks 5 & 6)     Infographic (Weeks 7 & 8)     Video Presentation (Weeks 9 & 10) The scenario:  Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the trends of airline safety and that things are not looking good. What was previously thought as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles, is now being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public. But are any of these claims based on facts?  You work for an airline on the data science team as a data analyst and are a resident data visualization expert. You have been tasked with helping multiple groups in the organization combat this negative publicity and help tell the airline's side of the story. There is a fear internally about what this type of media coverage will do to airline sales and how it could impact the future of the company. Not only do they need you to help create some internal communications, but you will also be tasked with what is published to the public and the media.  Project Task 1: Dashboard  Your first task is to create an internal dashboard for your peers and data science management team that outlines the facts ‚Äì what are the stats and what are the trends? Is there any supplemental data that you can use to support that air travel is still in fact the safest? Is there anything politically going on that would cause this type of media attention to be at a peak ‚Äì remember, this is for an internal review by your peers and management ‚Äì and will likely spark a lot of discussion for how you approach the next level of discussion with your executive leadership team. Is there anything to show sales are down or are headed that way? Do the safety incidents appear to be in a specific geographic area or by a specific airline every time? Do some analysis of the data you have and look for other sources to see what you can find to help inform your internal team.  Project Task 2: Executive Summary  Your dashboard was well received by the internal team and while some of the information was news to everyone, the entire consensus was that it is ready to be prepped for an executive review, so the external communications can be started. Your next task is to prepare an executive summary summarizing your findings and telling the story of what you found. This can be done either in PowerPoint, Prezi, Spark, etc.  Remember your audience ‚Äì these will be senior leaders that care about the portrayal of the industry and their airline specifically. They also want to make sure they are being ethical and sharing information that isn‚Äôt misleading. This presentation will set the tone for how the media is addressed going forward with the information and facts that need to be shared. Also remember that this audience regularly speaks with shareholders ‚Äì so any information you can find to help predict future risks and the position of the company will be beneficial to the conversation. For example, if you found information that indicates where future sales will be impacted or where there are safety risks ‚Äì this is important information to raise to this group.  Project Task 3: Blog Post  Now that you have given your presentation to your executive team, they have given you the remainder of your tasks because they want you to urgently get the word out ‚Äì which you will complete over the remainder of the course. A blog post that they can use to spread through online news sources, social media, etc., an infographic that can be shared in print, like in airports, as well as social media, and a short video clip with some of the important facts to help inform the public.  Your presentation and clarity of the story for these last three tasks will be of the utmost importance since the presentations will be to external audiences.  Your first task is to get the blog post out ‚Äì which will be mostly in the written form, with the back-up of some visualizations. Select some of the visualizations you have already presented, determine what modifications need to be made to improve those visualizations, potentially using Inkscape and start drafting your story. Refer to Chapter 7 of Storytelling with Data for suggestions on how to frame up your blog post. Get creative ‚Äì remember, you are trying to get your side of the story out and share the facts with the public!  Project Task 4: Infographic  You‚Äôve successfully gotten your blog post out, which has started to be shared with local news outlets and you have seen it shared on various platforms. While somewhat controversial in the data visualization world, you have been diligently working on an infographic that has nice clear, creative visuals that help articulate the message and inform the public what the real story is! This audience is likely standing in line and would see this infographic on a wall or is scrolling on their phone quickly ‚Äì so grabbing their attention is key and making sure the visualizations makes sense is the only way you can change their opinion or inform them of what is really going on.  Project Task 5: Video Presentation  Your final task to help spread the word on the truth about what you have found and represent your Airline via a short 3-minute presentation (recorded) that combines the 3-minute story and the Big Idea from Storytelling with Data in Chapter 1. The premise of the 3-minute story, is that you must find a way to convey everything you need to in that short timeframe, which you do using any of the previous media that you have created or something brand new. You can choose to present a PowerPoint, just talk live in front of a camera presenting the facts or talk while presenting your Dashboard, etc. You could also create a moving visualization like some of the time series visualizations we have seen Edward Tufte create or Hans Rosling‚Äôs for example: (https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo)""}",,1

The Flying Wing is a portable form of transportation, being encased in a backpack that folds out into an aircraft for manned flight.

The simulation accounted for a 80kg person, 20kg space suit, 180kg of fuel and a 100kg payload.

Its cruise speed (207 mph or 333 km/h) and range (1,500 mi or 2,400 km) revolutionized air transport in the 1930s and 1940s. Its lasting effect on the airline industry and World War II makes it one of the most significant transport aircraft ever made.  The DC-3 was a twin-engine metal monoplane, developed as a larger, improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2. It had many exceptional qualities compared to previous aircraft. It was fast, had a good range and could operate from short runways. Its construction was all-metal. It was reliable and easy to maintain and carried passengers in greater comfort. Before the war it pioneered many air travel routes. It was able to cross the continental United States, making transcontinental flights and worldwide flights possible, and is considered the first airliner that could make money by carrying passengers alone.[4]  Civil DC-3 production ended in 1942 with 607 aircraft being produced. However, together with its military derivative, the C-47 Skytrain (designated the Dakota in British Royal Air Force (RAF) service), and with Russian- and Japanese-built versions, over 16,000 were built. Following the Second World War, the airliner market was flooded with surplus C-47s and other ex-military transport aircraft, and Douglas' attempts to produce an upgraded DC-3 were a failure due to cost.  While the DC-3 was soon made redundant on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation, the design continued to prove exceptionally adaptable and useful.

The first flight carried a man up to height of one foot and lasted 12 seconds, while modern commercial flights fly passengers through the half of the earth and last about 15 hours.     4. Water distribution As population grew in many of the Western countries, water was in huge demand and a need for regulated supply was inevitable. A new form of distribution system took care of the demand, more so as the previous system posed a risk hazard.    5. Electronics In the year 1948, talk of the first transistor developed through an ordinary vacuum tube was heard by a New York Times reporter who did not seem influenced by the prospects of the new development. He described it sarcastically and as being casual.   6. Radio and Television Before 1899, there was no way people could know the outcome of boat-races instantly, but this was made possible for the America Cup event between the Shamrock of the Irish Ulster Yacht Club and the Columbia from the New York Yacht Club. A newspaper observed the results of the race would come as fast as travelling light.   7. Agricultural Mechanization Agriculture, known as one of the oldest professions, was boosted by introduction of tools and machines to better utilize the landscape with development of crop circles as part of an automated irrigation system. The crop circles can be observed in a checkerboard pattern - green, golden and brown ‚Äì while travelling in jets across the country.   8. Computers Altair 8800, the first known microcomputer, was first depicted in 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, priced at $397. The machine had a memory of just 256 bytes and the output was in the form of flashing lights. Programming had to be done moving toggles, contrary to the super-fast microcomputers known today.   9. Telephone An instrument for reproducing the tones and articulations of a speaker‚Äôs voice was invented by Alexander Graham Bell, who first wrote about it in 1877 for the first time. Private houses and dwellings, in addition to shops and factories could be connected by underground cables, the inventor suggested.   10. Air conditioning and refrigeration Refrigerator, which was thought to be a luxury before the late 20th century, had become a necessity at the turn of the century in estimated 99.5% of the homes. Respondents mentioned it as one of the essential utilities in a household.  ",,0

The factors that were fueling the growth of the market before the COVID-19 pandemic include the expected capacity growth owing to new aircraft deliveries, lowered operating costs, and grounding of older airplanes, and increased fuel-efficient aircraft. Additionally, increased economic activity and a growing global economy had provided the basis for the North American aviation industry to grow in recent years.  However, with the outbreak of COVID-19 since December 2019, the industry of North America Aviation has shown some discouraging results in the growth rate. The US has travel advisories or outright bans in order to restrict the spread of the virus. Also, the combination of trip cancellations and country-specific restrictions on international flights is costing the North American aviation industry with a sudden decrease in the revenue. By the end of March 2020, the US has registered the highest cases of COVID-19 that is more than 100,000. Moreover, Canada has also registered around 5,000 cases due to the pandemic. To prevent the further spreading of the virus the airline companies are suspending or canceling the domestic as well as international air services.

407,https://github.com/Hamida-del/Course-Project-2.git,"Course Data Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).
