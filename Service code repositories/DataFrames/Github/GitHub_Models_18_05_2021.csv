A different model is trained for every number of possible speakers, and the model with the largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample.

0,https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoiser.git,"Real Time Speech Enhancement in the Waveform Domain (Interspeech 2020)We provide a PyTorch implementation of the paper Real Time Speech Enhancement in the Waveform Domain. In which, we present a causal speech enhancement model working on the raw waveform that runs in real-time on a laptop CPU. The proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections. It is optimized on both time and frequency domains, using multiple loss functions. Empirical evidence shows that it is capable of removing various kinds of background noise including stationary and non-stationary noises, as well as room reverb. Additionally, we suggest a set of data augmentation techniques applied directly on the raw waveform which further improve model performance and its generalization abilities.",,540
