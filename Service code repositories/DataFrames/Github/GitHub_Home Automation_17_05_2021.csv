We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don‚Äôt worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It‚Äôs important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type in required files and resources with the proper names. All names are case sensitive, so a name like ""Web1"" is not the same as ""web1"". If you misspell a name, use the wrong case, or put a file in the wrong directory location you will lose points on your assignment. This is the easiest way to lose points, and also the most preventable. You should always double-check your work to make sure it accurately reflects the requirements specified in the assignment. You should always carefully review the content of your files before submitting your assignment.  The assignment Let‚Äôs get started!  Create GitHub repository The first step in the assignment is to setup a Git repository on GitHub. We will use a special solution called GitHub Classroom for this course which automates the process of setting up student assignment repositories.  Here are the basic steps:  Click on the following link to open Assignment 2 on the GitHub Classroom site: https://classroom.github.com/a/K4zcVmX- (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.  Click on the Accept this assignment button.  GitHub Classroom will provide you with a URL (https) to access the assignment repository. Either copy this address to your clipboard or write it down somewhere. You will need to use this address to set up the repository on a Linux server.  Example: https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git At this point your new repository to ready to use. The repository is currently empty. We will put some content in there soon!  Launch Linux server The second step in the assignment is to launch a Linux server using AWS EC2. The server should have the following characteristics:  Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit (usually the first option listed)  Located in a U.S. region (us-east-1)  t2.micro instance type  All default instance settings (storage, vpm, security group, etc.)  I‚Äôve shown you how to launch EC2 instances in class. You can review it on Canvas.  Once you launch the new server, it may take a few minutes to provision.  Log into server The next step is to log into the Linux server using a terminal program with a secure shell (SSH) support. You can use iTerm2 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a Mac and GitBash/PuTTY (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. on a PC.  You will need to have the private server key and the public IP address before attempting to log into the server. The server key is basically your password. If you lose it, you will need to terminate the existing instance and launch a new server. I recommend reusing the same key when launching new servers throughout the class. Note, I make this recommendation to make the learning process easier and not because it is a common security practice.  I‚Äôve shown you how to use a terminal application to log into the instance using a Windows desktop. Your personal computer or lab computer may be running a different OS version, but the process is still very similar. You can review the videos on the Canvas.  Working with Linux If you‚Äôve made it this far, congratulations! You‚Äôve made it over the toughest hurdle. By the end of this course, I promise you will be able to launch and log into servers in your sleep.  You should be looking at a login screen that looks something like this:  Last login: Mon Mar 21 21:17:54 2016 from 174-20-199-194.mpls.qwest.net  __|  __|_  )  _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI ___|\\___|___| https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2015.09-release-notes/ 8 package(s) needed for security, out of 17 available Run ""sudo yum update"" to apply all updates. ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 ~]$ Your terminal cursor is sitting at the shell prompt, waiting for you to type in your first command. Remember the shell? It is a really cool program that lets you start other programs and manage services on the Linux system. The rest of this assignment will be spent working with the shell.  Note, when you are asked to type in a command in the steps below, don‚Äôt type in the dollar-sign ($) character. This is just meant to represent the command prompt. The actual commands are represented by the characters to the right of the command prompt.  Let‚Äôs start by asking the shell for some help. Type in:  $ help The shell provides you with a list of commands you can run along with possible command options.  Next, check out one of the pages in the built-in manual:  $ man ls A man page will appear with information on how to use the ls command. This command is used to list the contents of file directories. Either space through the contents of the man page or hit q to exit.  Most of the core Linux commands have man pages available. But honestly, some of these man pages are a bit hard to understand. Sometimes your best bet is to search on Google if you are trying to figure out how to use a specific command.  When you initially log into Linux, the system places you in your home directory. Each user on the system has a separate home directory. Let‚Äôs see where your home directory is located:  $ pwd The response should be /home/ec2-user. The pwd command is handy to remember if you ever forget what file directory you are currently located in. If you recall from the Linux Hands-on Guide, this directory is also your current working directory.  Type in:  $ cd / The cd command let‚Äôs you change to a new working directory on the server. In this case, we changed to the root (/) directory. This is the parent of all the other directories on the file system.  Type in:  $ ls The ls command lists the contents of the current directory. As you can see, root directory contains many other directories. You will become familiar with these directories over time.  The ls command provides a very basic directory listing. You need to supply the command with some options if you want to see more detailed information.  Type in:  $ ls -la See how this command provides you with much more detailed information about the files and directories? You can use this detailed listing to see the owner, group, and access control list settings for each file or directory. Do you see any files listed? Remember, the first character in the access control list column denotes whether a listed item is a file or a directory.  You probably see a couple files with names like .autofsck. How come you didn‚Äôt see this file when you typed in the lscommand without any options? (Try to run this command again to convince yourself.) Files names that start with a period are called hidden files. These files won‚Äôt appear on normal directory listings.  Type in:  $ cd /var Then, type in:  $ ls You will see a directory listing for the /var directory. Next, type in:  $ ls .. Huh. This directory listing looks the same as the earlier root directory listing. When you use two periods (..) in a directory path that means you are referring to the parent directory of the current directory. Just think of the two dots as meaning the directory above the current directory.  Now, type in:  $ cd ~ $ pwd Whoa. We‚Äôre back at our home directory again. The tilde character (~) is another one of those handy little directory path shortcuts. It always refers to our personal home directory. Keep in mind that since every user has their own home directory, the tilde shortcut will refer to a unique directory for each logged-in user.  Most students are used to navigating a file system by clicking a mouse in nested graphical folders. When they start using a command-line to navigate a file system, they sometimes get confused and lose track of their current position in the file system. Remember, you can always use the pwd command to quickly figure out what directory you are currently working in.  Let‚Äôs make some changes to the file system. We can easily make our own directories on the file system. Type:  mkdir test Now type:  ls Cool, there‚Äôs our new test directory. Let‚Äôs pretend we don‚Äôt like that directory name and delete it. Type:  rmdir test Now it‚Äôs gone. How can you be sure? You should know how to check to see if the directory still exists at this point. Go ahead and check.  Let‚Äôs create another directory. Type in:  $ mkdir documents Next, change to the new directory:  $ cd documents Did you notice that your command prompt displays the name of the current directory? Something like: [ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-26 documents]$. Pretty handy, huh?  Okay, let‚Äôs create our first file in the documents directory. This is just an empty file for training purposes. Type in:  $ touch paper.txt Check to see that the new file is in the directory. Now, go back to the previous directory. Remember the double dot shortcut?  $ cd .. Okay, we don‚Äôt like our documents directory any more. Let‚Äôs blow it away. Type in:  $ rmdir documents Uh oh. The shell didn‚Äôt like that command because the directory isn‚Äôt empty. Let‚Äôs change back into the documents directory. But this time don‚Äôt type in the full name of the directory. You can let shell auto-completion do the typing for you. Type in the first couple characters of the directory name and then hit the tab key:  $ cd doc<tab> You should use the tab auto-completion feature often. It saves typing and makes working with the Linux file system much much easier. Tab is your friend.  Now, remove the file by typing:  $ rm paper.txt Did you try to use the tab key instead of typing in the whole file name? Check to make sure the file was deleted from the directory.  Next, create a new file:  $ touch file1 We like file1 so much that we want to make a backup copy. Type:  $ cp file1 file1-backup Check to make sure the new backup copy was created. We don‚Äôt really like the name of that new file, so let‚Äôs rename it. Type:  $ mv file1-backup backup Moving a file to the same directory and giving it a new name is basically the same thing as renaming it. We could have moved it to a different directory if we wanted.  Let‚Äôs list all of the files in the current directory that start with the letter f:  $ ls f* Using wildcard pattern matching in file commands is really useful if you want the command to impact or filter a group of files. Now, go up one directory to the parent directory (remember the double dot shortcut?)  We tried to remove the documents directory earlier when it had files in it. Obviously that won‚Äôt work again. However, we can use a more powerful command to destroy the directory and vanquish its contents. Behold, the all powerful remove command:  $ rm -fr documents Did you remember to use auto-completion when typing in documents? This command and set of options forcibly removes the directory and its contents. It‚Äôs a dangerous command wielded by the mightiest Linux wizards. Okay, maybe that‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration. Just be careful with it.  Check to make sure the documents directory is gone before proceeding.  Let‚Äôs continue. Change to the directory /var and make a directory called test.  Ugh. Permission denied. We created this darn Linux server and we paid for it. Shouldn‚Äôt we be able to do anything we want on it? You logged into the system as a user called ec2-user. While this user can create and manage files in its home directory, it cannot change files all across the system. At least it can‚Äôt as a normal user. The ec2-user is a member of the root group, so it can escalate its privileges to super-user status when necessary. Let‚Äôs try it:  $ sudo mkdir test Check to make sure the directory exists now. Using sudo we can execute commands as a super-user. We can do anything we want now that we know this powerful new command.  Go ahead and delete the test directory. Did you remember to use sudo before the rmdir command? Check to make sure the directory is gone.  You might be asking yourself the question: why can we list the contents of the /var directory but not make changes? That‚Äôs because all users have read access to the /var directory and the ls command is a read function. Only the root users or those acting as a super-user can write changes to the directory.  Let‚Äôs go back to our home directory:  $ cd ~ Editing text files is a really common task on Linux systems because many of the application configuration files are text files. We can create a text file by using a text editor. Type in:  $ nano myfile.conf The shell starts up the nano text editor and places your terminal cursor in the editing screen. Nano is a simple text-based word processor. Type in a few lines of text. When you‚Äôre done writing your novel, hit ctrl-x and answer y to the prompt to save your work. Finally, hit enter to save the text to the filename you specified.  Check to see that your file was saved in the directory. You can take a look at the contents of your file by typing:  $ cat myfile.conf The cat command displays your text file content on the terminal screen. This command works fine for displaying small text files. But if your file is hundreds of lines long, the content will scroll down your terminal screen so fast that you won‚Äôt be able to easily read it. There‚Äôs a better way to view larger text files. Type in:  $ less myfile.conf The less command will page the display of a text file, allowing you to page through the contents of the file using the space bar. Your text file is probably too short to see the paging in action though. Hit q to quit out of the less text viewer.  Hit the up-arrow key on your keyboard a few times until the commmand nano myfile.conf appears next to your command prompt. Cool, huh? The up-arrow key allows you to replay a previously run command. Linux maintains a list of all the commands you have run since you logged into the server. This is called the command history. It‚Äôs a really useful feature if you have to re-run a complex command again.  Now, hit ctrl-c. This cancels whatever command is displayed on the command line.  Type in the following command to create a couple empty files in the directory:  $ touch file1 file2 file3 Confirm that the files were created. Some commands, like touch. allow you to specify multiple files as arguments. You will find that Linux commands have all kinds of ways to make tasks more efficient like this.  Throughout this assignment, we have been running commands and viewing results on the terminal screen. The screen is the standard place for commands to output results. It‚Äôs known as the standard out (stdout). However, it‚Äôs really useful to output results to the file system sometimes. Type in:  $ ls > listing.txt Take a look at the directory listing now. You just created a new file. View the contents of the listing.txt file. What do you see? Instead of sending the output from the ls command to the screen we sent it to a text file.  Let‚Äôs try another one. Type:  $ cat myfile.conf > listing.txt Take a look at the contents of the listing.txt file again. It looks like your myfile.conf file now. It‚Äôs like you made a copy of it. But what happened to the previous content in the listing.txt file? When you redirect the output of a command using the right angle-bracket character (>), the output overwrites the existing file. Type this command in:  $ cat myfile.conf >> listing.txt Now look at the contents of the listing.txt file. You should see your original content displayed twice. When you use two angle-bracket characters in the commmand the output appends (or adds to) the file instead of overwriting it.  We redirected the output from a command to a text file. It‚Äôs also possible to redirect the input to a command. Typically we use a keyboard to provide input, but sometimes it makes more sense to input a file to a command. For example, how many words are in your new listing.txt file? Let‚Äôs find out. Type in:  $ wc -w < listing.txt Did you get a number? This command inputs the listing.txt file into a word count program called wc.  Type in the command:  $ ls /usr/bin The terminal screen probably scrolled quickly as filenames flashed by. The /usr/bin directory holds quite a few files. It would be nice if we could page through the contents of this directory. Well, we can. We can use a special shell feature called pipes. In previous steps, we redirected I/O using the file system. Pipes allow us to redirect I/O between programs. We can redirect the output from one program into another. Type in:  $ ls /usr/bin | less Now the directory listing is paged. Hit the spacebar to page through the listing. The pipe, represented by a vertical bar character (|), takes the output from the ls command and redirects it to the less command where the resulting output is paged. Pipes are super powerful and used all the time by savvy Linux operators.  Hit the q key to quit the paginated directory listing command.  Working with shell scripts Now things are going to get interesting.  We‚Äôve been manually typing in commands throughout this exercise. If we were running a set of repetitive tasks, we would want to automate the process as much as possible. The shell makes it really easy to automate tasks using shell scripts. The shell provides many of the same features as a basic procedural programming language. Let‚Äôs write some code.  Type in this command:  $ j=123 $ echo $j We just created a variable named j referencing the string 123. The echo command printed out the value of the variable. We had to use a dollar sign ($) when referencing the variable in another command.  Next, type in:  $ j=1+1 $ echo $j Is that what you expected? The shell just interprets the variable value as a string. It‚Äôs not going to do any sort of computation.  Typing in shell script commands on the command line is sort of pointless. We want to be able to create scripts that we can run over-and-over. Let‚Äôs create our first shell script.  Use the nano editor to create a file named myscript. When the file is open in the editor, type in the following lines of code:  #!/bin/bash echo Hello $1 Now quit the editor and save your file. We can run our script by typing:  $ ./myscript World Er, what happened? Permission denied. Didn‚Äôt we create this file? Why can‚Äôt we run it? We can‚Äôt run the script file because we haven‚Äôt set the execute permission on the file. Type in:  $ chmod u+x myscript This modifies the file access control list to allow the owner of the file to execute it. Let‚Äôs try to run the command again. Hit the up-arrow key a couple times until the ./myscript World command is displayed and hit enter.  Hooray! Our first shell script. It‚Äôs probably a bit underwhelming. No problem, we‚Äôll make it a little more complex. The script took a single argument called World. Any arguments provided to a shell script are represented as consecutively numbered variables inside the script ($1, $2, etc). Pretty simple.  You might be wondering why we had to type the ./ characters before the name of our script file. Try to type in the command without them:  $ myscript World Command not found. That seems a little weird. Aren‚Äôt we currently in the directory where the shell script is located? Well, that‚Äôs just not how the shell works. When you enter a command into the shell, it looks for the command in a predefined set of directories on the server called your PATH. Since your script file isn‚Äôt in your special path, the shell reports it as not found. By typing in the ./ characters before the command name you are basically forcing the shell to look for your script in the current directory instead of the default path.  Create another file called cleanup using nano. In the file editor window type:  #!/bin/bash # My cleanup script mkdir archive mv file* archive Exit the editor window and save the file. Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Now run the command:  $ ./cleanup Take a look at the file directory listing. Notice the archive directory? List the contents of that directory. The script automatically created a new directory and moved three files into it. Anything you can do manually at a command prompt can be automated using a shell script.  Let‚Äôs create one more shell script. Use nano to create a script called namelist. Here is the content of the script:  #!/bin/bash # for-loop test script names=\'Jason John Jane\' for i in $names do   echo Hello $i done Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Run the command:  $ ./namelist The script will loop through a set of names stored in a variable displaying each one. Scripts support several programming constructs like for-loops, do-while loops, and if-then-else. These building blocks allow you to create fairly complex scripts for automating tasks.  Installing packages and services We‚Äôre nearing the end of this assignment. But before we finish, let‚Äôs install some new software packages on our server. The first thing we should do is make sure all the current packages installed on our Linux server are up-to-date. Type in:  $ sudo yum update -y This is one of those really powerful commands that requires sudo access. The system will review the currently installed packages and go out to the Internet and download appropriate updates.  Next, let‚Äôs install an Apache web server on our system. Type in:  $ sudo yum install httpd -y Bam! You probably never knew that installing a web server was so easy. We‚Äôre not going to actually use the web server in this exercise, but we will in future assignments.  We installed the web server, but is it actually running? Let‚Äôs check. Type in:  $ sudo service httpd status Nope. Let‚Äôs start it. Type:  $ sudo service httpd start We can use the service command to control the services running on the system. Let‚Äôs setup the service so that it automatically starts when the system boots up. Type in:  $ sudo chkconfig httpd on Cool. We installed the Apache web server on our system, but what other programs are currently running? We can use the pscommand to find out. Type in:  $ ps -ax Lots of processes are running on our system. We can even look at the overall performance of our system using the topcommand. Let‚Äôs try that now. Type in:  $ top The display might seem a little overwhelming at first. You should see lots of performance information displayed including the cpu usage, free memory, and a list of running tasks.  We‚Äôre almost across the finish line. Let‚Äôs make sure all of our valuable work is stored in a git repository. First, we need to install git. Type in the command:  $ sudo yum install git -y Check your work It‚Äôs very important to check your work before submitting it for grading. A misspelled, misplaced or missing file will cost you points. This may seem harsh, but the reality is that these sorts of mistakes have consequences in the real world. For example, a server instance could fail to launch properly and impact customers because a single required file is missing.  Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:  ‚î£archive ‚îÉ  ‚î£ file1 ‚îÉ  ‚î£ file2 ‚îÉ  ‚îó file3 ‚î£ namelist ‚îó myfile.conf  Saving our work in the git repository Next, make sure you are still in your home directory (/home/ec2-user). We will install the git repository you created at the beginning of this exercise. You will need to modify this command by typing in the GitHub repository URL you copied earlier.  $ git clone <your GitHub URL here>.git Example: git clone https://github.com/UST-SEIS665/hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<your github id>.git The git application will ask you for your GitHub username and password. Note, if you have multi-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account you will need to provide a personal token instead of your password.  Git will clone (copy) the repository from GitHub to your Linux server. Since the repository is empty the clone happens almost instantly. Check to make sure that a sub-directory called ""hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username>"" exists in the current directory (where <username> is your GitHub account name). Git automatically created this directory as part of the cloning process.  Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and type:  $ ls -la Notice the .git hidden directory? This is where git actually stores all of the file changes in your repository. Nothing is actually in your repository yet.  Change back to the parent directory (cd ..). Next, let‚Äôs move some of our files into the repository. Type:  $ mv archive hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv namelist hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> $ mv myfile.conf hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> Hopefully, you remembered to use the auto-complete function to reduce some of that typing. Change to the hw2-seis665-02-spring2019-<username> directory and list the directory contents. Your files are in the working directory, but are not actually stored in the repository because they haven‚Äôt been committed yet.  Type in:  $ git status You should see a list of untracked files. Let‚Äôs tell git that we want these files tracked. Type in:  $ git add * Now type in the git status command again. Notice how all the files are now being tracked and are ready to be committed. These files are in the git staging area. We‚Äôll commit them to the repository next. Type:  $ git commit -m \'assignment 2 files\' Next, take a look at the commit log. Type:  $ git log You should see your commit listed along with an assigned hash (long string of random-looking characters).  Finally, let‚Äôs save the repository to our GitHub account. Type in:  $ git push origin master The git client will ask you for your GitHub username and password before pushing the repository.  Go back to the GitHub.com website and login if you have been logged out. Click on the repository link for the assignment. Do you see your files listed there? Congratulations, you completed the exercise!  Terminate server  The last step is to terminate your Linux instance. AWS will bill you for every hour the instance is running. The cost is nominal, but there‚Äôs no need to rack up unnecessary charges.  Here are the steps to terminate your instance:  Log into your AWS account and click on the EC2 dashboard.  Click the Instances menu item.  Select your server in the instances table.  Click on the Actions drop down menu above the instances table.  Select the Instance State menu option  Click on the Terminate action.  Your Linux instance will shutdown and disappear in a few minutes. The EC2 dashboard will continue to display the instance on your instance listing for another day or so. However, the state of the instance will be terminated.  Submitting your assignment ‚Äî IMPORTANT! If you haven‚Äôt already, please e-mail me your GitHub username in order to receive credit for this assignment. There is no need to email me to tell me that you have committed your work to GitHub or to ask me if your GitHub submission worked. If you can see your work in your GitHub repository, I can see your work.",,6

Despite there being applications available to control the majority of connected home devices, few combine this into a single interface.  The project will involve designing a front end interface which will run on an Apple iPad. The application will communicate with the different elements of the system using AMX. A working prototype will demonstrate a range of communication methods including infra-red, RS232 and IP.  Home automation technologies simplify living, but also helps monitor energy efficiency and security. The project will incorporate a popular lighting control system, the Phillips Hue, which will result in significant energy savings for the user.\xa0  After conducting market research, it was noted that entertainment is a key element of home automation systems. With this in mind, the project will incorporate control of audio and video sources including Apple TV, Blu-ray player and much more.\xa0  The control system will be developed on a NetLinx NX-3200 integrated controller and programmed in AMX NetLinx code.

This system reduces human effort and also saves time and money. This scheme monitors the efficient use of electricity and hence conserves the energy which is the need of the hour. Although the prospect of computerized homes has a long history, home automation has never become terribly popular because the benefits are seldom seen to outweigh the costs. One significant cost of an automated home is that someone has to program it to behave in an adaptive manner. We describe a system that automates the ambient illumination in a room. We have noticed that hardly any attention is paid to the light entering the room from outside. Our system varies the intensity of ambient light in the room based on the amount of light entering it. We also have occupancy sensors includes entry/exit sensors for detecting movement through doorways. The system is built in such a way that over the period of time it recognizes the pattern of usage of the residents and adapts accordingly. We have built a prototype system that works on a single room. Further improvements are suggested for the scope of future work.",,4

Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation system provides a most modern solution with smart phones. People come home exhausted after a long working day so any small device that would help them switch their lights and fans would make their home more comfortable.

In the original CrowdRE dataset, each entry has 6 attributes, i.e., role, feature, benefit, domain, tags and date-time of creation. Since, we are interested in extracting domain-specific terms from this dataset, we only focus on feature and benefit attributes of this dataset. The dataset used in our experiments containing only the feature and benefit attributes of the original CrowdRE dataset can be viewed in the file named ""CrowdRE Requirements Dataset.csv"". However, the original CrowdRE dataset is devloped by P. K. Murukannaiah et al. and can be accessed from ""The smarthome crowd requirements dataset"", https://crowdre.github.io/murukannaiah-smarthome-requirements-dataset/, April, 2017.  We have computed and reported the ground truth set for a random subset of 100 requirement specifications of the used CrowdRE dataset. In total, we have manually identified a total of 120 ground truth glossary terms with 30 overlapping clusters. The ground truth glossary terms have been calculated from the best intuition of the people (s) involved in this project in an unbiased manner, as there exists no benchmark or gold standard related to the ground truth extraction and clustering for the CrowdRE dataset. The file named ""Ground Truth Clusters.docx"" shows the ground truth glossary terms along with the manually formulated semantically similar clusters. Note: the clusters are separated with (######) symbol in the file. Further, the manually identified 120 glossary terms in the ground truth set are shown in the third column of the file named as ""Extracted Glossary Terms (With and Without WordNet Removal) and Ground Truth Glossary Terms.csv"".  We have extracted a total of 143 and 292 glossary terms from the CrowdRE dataset with or without removing some words specified in the WordNet lexical database (https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) using a mature text chunking approach. The results are shown in the first and second column of the file named ""Extracted Glossary Terms (With and Without WordNet Removal) and Ground Truth Glossary Terms.csv"". The extracted glossary terms are trained with the help of a domain specific corpora that is most related to used CrowdRE dataset, i.e. (Wikipedia Home Automation Category for a maximum depth of two, ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Home_automation"") and with a pre-trained word vectors UMBC webbase corpus and statmt.org news dataset trained with subwords information in wikipedia 2017 (T. Mikolov, E. Grave, P. Bojanowski, C. Puhrsch, A. Joulin. Advances in Pre-Training Distributed Word Representations) using FastText word embedding vectors (https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html). The main purpose of the training is to deduce the clusters by forming a the similarity matrix for the extracted glossary terms. For this, we have used two clustering algorithms, viz. K-Means and EM clustering algorithms. The similarity matrix have been developed using the computed semantic similarity scores (cosine similarity) between the word vectors using the word embedding based FastText model. The results in terms of automated formulated clusters for the random subset of 100 requirement specifications of the CrowdRE dataset for which the ground truth glossary terms are calculated are shown in the files named ""Automated Ideal (Ground Truth) Clusters.docx"" and ""Automated Extraction and Clustering.docx"" respectively. Note: there exists a maximum of n/2 clusters for n glossary terms.  For evaluating the efficacy of the clustering algorithms, we used some commonly used performance evaluation metrics like (precision, recall, f-scores). The evaluation graphs utilizing the area under curve plots (AUC) and evaluating the normalized AUC scores for all the used clustering algorithms are trained on two different datasets and the evaluation results are shown in the two separate files namely, ""Cluster Plots.docx"" and ""Extraction +Clustering Plots.docx"" respectively.",,3

Jack Diode IN 4007 General PCB Board Wires Adaptor 5V 2 Amps Relay ConnectorIntroduction:- This is IoT based home automation project is done using low cost NodeMCU module, It uses relays and few simple components, four electrical devices can be controlled, Temperature and Humidity can be monitored. NodeMCU is low cost module is used here. The electrical devices can be controlled by the help of Google assistance and by the blynk android app. In contrast, Wireless system can be of great help for automation systems. With the advancement of wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Cloud networks in the recent past, Wireless systems are used every day and every where.          FUNCTIONS OF BASIC  COMPONENTS USED: NODE MCU: NodeMCU is an open source development board and firmware based in the  widely used\xa0ESP8266 -12E Wi-Fi module With its USB-TTL ,the nodeMCU  board supports directly flashing from USB port. It combines features of WIFI  accesspoint and station + microcontroller. These features \xa0 make the NodeMCU  extremly powerful tool for Wi-Fi networking. It can be used as accesspoint and/or  station, host a webserver or connect to internet to fetch or upload data.-In our  project pins D1,D2,D7 and D8 are used to automate two lights and two fans  respectively.Pin A0 is connected to LDR.D6 is connected to DHT11 DHT11:It is a sensor which is used to sense temperature and humidity of a   particular area. LDR:It is a Light Dependent Resistor  used to sense the intensity of light.Here  we are using a  LDR which has a maximum value of 1024. Relay: A\xa0relay\xa0is an electrally operated switch. Many relays use an Electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch. Relays are used where it is  necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several  circuits must be controlled by one signal.In our project we have used  6volt  relays to control two lights and two fans respectively.    Transistor: A\xa0transistor\xa0is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.In our project we have used transistor BC547  whose base is connected to node mcu ,emitter to ground and collector to Relay. LED:In our project we have used Two LED‚Äôs one Red and one Yellow.When the circuit is on Red light glows and when we there is a online connection established  between the server and circuit yellow led glows. DC JACK: A\xa0DC connector\xa0(or\xa0DC plug, for one common type of connector) is an\xa0electrical connector\xa0for supplying\xa0direct current(DC) power. Diode: Main functions. The most common function of a\xa0diode\xa0is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the\xa0diode's\xa0forward direction), while blocking it in the opposite direction (the reverse direction).In our circuit  the positive pin of diodes are connected to  Relay. General PCB Board:In our circuit we have used PCB instead of Breadboard and we have soldered each and every connection to make the connections tight  and Errorfree.It  also makes it easier to carry. Adaptor:An adaptor is used to connect to switch boards so that it can work on fans and lights directly. Relay Connector:It is used to connect Relays       Future Scope:-  Future scope for the home automation systems involves making homes even smarter. Homes can be interfaced with the sensors including light sensor, Temperature & Humidity  Sensors and provide automated toggling of devices based on conditions. More energy  can be conserved by insuring occupation of the house before turning on devices and checking  Brightness and turning off light if not necessary. The system can be integrated  Closely with home security solutions to allow greater control & safety for home owners. The next step can be to extend this system to automate a large scale environment,  Such as offices and factories. Home automation offers a global standard for interoperable Products. Standardization enables smart homes that can control appliances, lightings, Environment, energy management and security as well as the expandability to connect with  Other networks.
