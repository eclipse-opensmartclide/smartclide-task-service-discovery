It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. Customer loyalty and customer churn always add up to 100%. If a firm has a 60% of loyalty rate, then their loss or churn rate of customers is 40%. As per 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. So, it is very important to predict the users likely to churn from business relationship and the factors affecting the customer decisions.

0,https://github.com/Aghoreshwar/Awesome-Customer-Analytics.git,"Customer analytics has been one of hottest buzzwords for years. Few years back it was only marketing department’s monopoly carried out with limited volumes of customer data, which was stored in relational databases like Oracle or appliances like Teradata and Netezza. SAS & SPSS were the leaders in providing customer analytics but it was restricted to conducting segmentation of customers who are likely to buy your products or services. In the 90’s came web analytics, it was more popular for page hits, time on sessions, use of cookies for visitors and then using that for customer analytics.  By the late 2000s, Facebook, Twitter and all the other socialchannels changed the way people interacted with brands and each other. Businesses needed to have a presence on the major social sites to stay relevant. With the digital age things have changed drastically. Customer issuperman now. Their mobile interactions have increased substantially and they leave digital footprint everywhere they go. They are more informed, more connected, always on and looking for exceptionally simple and easy experience. This tsunami of data has changed the customer analytics forever. Today customer analytics is not only restricted to marketing forchurn and retention but more focus is going on how to improve thecustomer experience and is done by every department of the organization. A lot of companies had problems integrating large bulk of customer data between various databases and warehouse systems. They are not completely sure of which key metrics to use for profiling customers. Hence creating customer 360 degree view became the foundation for customer analytics. It can capture all customer interactions which can be used for further analytics.  From the technology perspective, the biggest change is the introduction of big data platforms which can do the analytics very fast on all the data organization has, instead of sampling and segmentation. Then came Cloud based platforms, which can scale up and down as per the need of analysis, so companies didn’t have to invest upfront on infrastructure. Predictive models of customer churn, Retention, Cross-Sell do exist today as well, but they run against more data than ever before. Even analytics has further evolved from descriptive to predictive to prescriptive. Only showing what will happen next is not helping anymore but what actions you need to take is becoming more critical.  There are various ways customer analytics is carried out:  Acquiring all the customer data Understanding the customer journey Applying big data concepts to customer relationships Finding high propensity prospects Upselling by identifying related products and interests Generating customer loyalty by discovering response patterns Predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) Identifying dissatisfied customers & churn patterns Applying predictive analytics Implementing continuous improvement Hyper-personalization is the center stage now which gives your customer the right message, on the right platform, using the right channel, at the right time. Now via Cognitive computing and Artificial Intelligence using IBM Watson, Microsoft and Google cognitive services, customer analytics will become sharper as their deep learning neural network algorithms provide a game changing aspect. Tomorrow there may not be just plain simple customer sentiment analytics based on feedback or surveys or social media, but with help of cognitive it may be what customer’s facial expressions show in real time. There’s no doubt that customer analytics is absolutely essential for brand survival.",,5

It can simulate store sales personnel to provide product information and suggestions to customers, and provide fully personalized decision support and information services for customers' shopping. Its goal is to Satisfying the needs of users, meeting the needs that users are not aware of, or realizing, but not expressing the needs, allowing users to go beyond the individual's vision and avoid seeing the trees without seeing the forest. A good recommendation system can greatly increase user loyalty and bring huge benefits to e-commerce.   Personalized recommendation is to recommend information and products of interest to users according to their interests and purchasing behavior. As the scale of e-commerce continues to expand, the number and variety of products grow rapidly, and customers need to spend a lot of time to find the products they want to buy. This kind of browsing of a large amount of unrelated information and product processes will undoubtedly cause consumers who are drowning in information overload problems to continue to lose. In order to solve these problems, a personalized recommendation system came into being.   The recommendation system is a branch of data mining. It is a special data mining system, which is mainly reflected in the real-time and interactivity of the recommendation system. The system recommends information that meets the interests of the user according to the user's interests, also known as the personalized recommendation system. It not only based on the user's past history, but also needs to react in real time with the behavior of the current period of time, and correct and optimize the recommendation result according to the feedback result of interaction with the user.""}",,2
0,https://github.com/soniachat8/Customer-Relationship-Management.git,"{""Customer Relationship Management: Will it sustain in the Future? “The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.” Masashi Kishimoto. Well, although that quote was made in the context of humans and our inherent capabilities, this thought can actually also be applied to anything that’s created by us. The more we learn, the better we apply. To build on that idea, let’s talk about one such small, albeit important, piece of creation – Customer Relationship Management, or simply CRM. The concept of CRM evolved from the 80s’ Rolodex devices, which were hailed for being the next-generation contact management tools at the time. After experiencing its highs and lows in the 90s and the beginning of the new millennia, CRM has grown and firmly rooted itself as an indispensable resource for businesses in the Information Age. But can it continue its run in the times to come? 1. Making sense of more and more data Most CRM software today have an efficient data collection tool embedded within themselves, which aims to recognize social patterns and make context-based decisions for the business. Markets are no longer influenced by businesses and corporate institutions; instead, it’s their entire customer base that has full control over each and every transaction. In the future, as big data becomes even more prominent, it’ll become extremely challenging for a business to analyze and make sense of the huge amount of customer data. CRM will have to build on analytical tools and make smarter decisions in order to serve a large customer base and keep them loyal. 2. Delivering a complete value package All businesses need to understand that their customers appreciate it when their queries and complaints are heard and resolved, and then some. The future of CRM has to be built on smarter data and trend analysis. Digging deeper and obtaining insight into their customers’ behavior will allow businesses to proactively create better product and service offerings, and address their needs more accurately. 3. A smarter CRM with a smarter AI As digital capabilities continue to grow, reliance on actual manpower becomes less prominent. This is essentially due to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to impart rationality to a machine and mirror the concept of ‘thought’ in them. In the same vein, as CRM becomes augmented with smarter AI, businesses are avoiding wasting precious time on the more monotonous and repetitive tasks. Along with this, the AI can make substantial studies on existing customer data and predict and deliver exact suggestions on sales and marketing activities. And it will constantly learn and re-calibrate itself to keep imparting more and more accuracy to these results, sans any human intervention. 4. Reaching business objectives efficiently At the end of the day, every business transaction is a value exchange between the company and its customer. And each business aims to maximize this value potential. Delivering an exceptional customer experience with CRM can greatly improve customer acquisition and loyalty rates, which can in turn exponentially increase the profit margins for the business. A more adept CRM can interpret market data and deliver better suggestions in a swift and productive manner.  As a CRM software keeps iterating and improving itself with the use of Artificial Intelligence, businesses can start to rely less on making uneducated decisions and come up with more meaningful strategies to engage with their customers organically. This not only fulfills the customers’ value requirements, but also makes the business more successful – a win-win situation for both the parties.""}",,2

To get started, just fork this repo and clone it locally  $ git clone https://github.com/YOURFORKEDPROJECT To get started please see the Quick Usage section of this README.  Proof Of Loyalty Pros Lightweight contract resulting in low gas execution calls User friendly for large communities No randomized reward process, everyone will be rewarded based on token loyalty Day Multiplier is executed with limited gas cost (no forloops are used for this function) Compounding interest can be included or removed depending on reward amount calculations (only during contract development cannot be changed after the contract is deployed) Interest Multiplier allows for multi tier rewards based on the conditions set during development (ie bob hold 1000 tokens he gets 10% APR sara holds 2000 tokens and she gets 20% APR ) Loyalty tokens are stored at an external address to prevent such attacks Loyalty rewards are given at the end of the loyalty cycle when the user calls withdraw loyalty to prevent malicious spending during supposed token loyalty Proof of Loyalty Cons/Issues Unknown storage growth over long periods of time with extremely large communities. Even tho the msg.senders strut mapping is deleted upon withdrawal, if the mapping exceeds 10000 addresses its hard to say the rewards values wouldn't be eaten by the gas cost to map over the array and execute the transaction. (this is why we recommend setting a required loyalty amount. Keep in mind to make this amount fair) One could assume due to a community actively trading this issue may not occur for a long period of time which a new contract can be redeployed.  Both the timestamp and the block hash can be influenced by miners to some degree. Bad actors in the mining community can for example run a casino payout function on a chosen hash and just retry a different hash if they did not receive any money. The current block timestamp must be strictly larger than the timestamp of the last block, but the only guarantee is that it will be somewhere between the timestamps of two consecutive blocks in the canonical chain.  Known Issues Known issues can be viewed publicly using pre audit reports compiled by Chainsecurity  Bug Bounty Bug bounties are subject to approved pull request or users bugs found by interactions with our TestNet contract.

Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective as you’ve already earned the trust and loyalty of existing customers.
