If CCS is implemented on large scale to make noticeable reductions in atmospheric CO2, then it will require a solid scientific foundation defining the coupled hydrologic–geochemical–geomechanical processes that govern the long-term fate of CO2 in the subsurface, migration behavior of CO2, trapping mechanisms, proper utilization of methods to characterize and select sequestration sites, workflow and evaluation process, simulation methods, subsurface engineering to optimize performance, well placement, injection rate and cost, approaches to ensure safe operation, monitoring technology, remediation methods, regulatory overview, and an institutional approach for managing long-term liability.

The geological data of the usual have raster, vector and so on, this paper pays attention to raster data processing.Tobler theorem tells us: geography everything associated with other things, but closer than far stronger correlation.Spatial correlation characteristics of geological data, the author of this paper, by establishing a spatial index R tree with spatial pattern mining algorithms as the guiding ideology, through the raster scanning method materialized space object space between adjacent relationship, transaction concept, thus the space with a pattern mining into the traditional association rules mining, and then take advantage of commonly used association rules to deal with some kind of geological data, to find association rules of interest. Using the simulation program to generate the geological data of the experiment, in the process of experiment, found a way to use R tree indexing can significantly speed up the generating spatial transaction set, at the same time, choose the more classic Apriori algorithm and FP - growth algorithm contrast performance, results show that the FP - growth algorithm is much faster than the Apriori algorithm, analyses the main reasons why the Apriori algorithm to generate a large number of candidate itemsets.In this paper, the main work is as follows: (1) In order to speed up the neighborhood search, choose to establish R tree spatial index, on the basis of summarizing the common scenarios to apply spatial indexing technology and the advantages and disadvantages. (2) Based on the analysis of traditional association rule mining algorithm and spatial association rule mining algorithm on the basis of the model based on event center space with pattern mining algorithm was described, and puts forward with a rule mining algorithm based on raster scanning, the algorithm by scanning for the center with a grid of R - neighborhood affairs set grid, will study data mining into the traditional data mining algorithm. (3) In the process of spatial index R tree insert, in order to prevent insertion to split after the leaf node, leading to a recursive has been split up destroy the one-way traverse, is put forward in the process of looking for insert position that records if full node number is M (M number) for each node up to insert nodes, first to divide to avoid after layers of recursive splitting up, speed up the R tree insertion efficiency. (4) On the basis of spatial transaction set preprocessing, realize the Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm two kinds of classic association rule mining algorithm, performance contrast analysis.",,9

The automatic identification of rock type in the field would aid geological surveying, education, and automatic mapping. It is a basic part of geological surveying and research, and mineral resources exploration. The automatic identification of rock type in the field would aid geological surveying, education, and automatic mapping. Working conditions in the field generally limit identification to visual methods, including using a magnifying glass for fine-grained rocks. Visual inspection assesses properties such as colour, composition, grain size, and structure. The attributes of rocks reflect their mineral and chemical composition, formation environment, and genesis. The colour of rock reflects its chemical composition. But these analysis is time taken process to identify the rocks.Its application here has effectively identified rock types from images captured in the field. This paper proposes an accurate approach for identifying rock types in the field based on image analysis using deep convolutional neural networks.   Solution: Deep learning is receiving significant research attention for pattern recognition and machine learning. Its application here has effectively identified rock types from images captured in the field. This paper proposes an accurate approach for identifying rock types in the field based on image analysis using deep convolutional neural networks. The results show that the proposed approach based on deep learning represents an improvement in intelligent rock-type identification and solves several difficulties facing the automated identification of rock types in the field.Who are experienced in the field of geological they can identify the rocks easily.

The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type. The areas of forest under study represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.  Data Overview : The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado which are as follows: 1 - Rawah Wilderness Area 2 - Neota Wilderness Area 3 - Comanche Peak Wilderness Area 4 - Cache la Poudre Wilderness Area  Our goal is to predict the forest cover type. The seven types of forest cover are : 1 - Spruce/Fir 2 - Lodgepole Pine 3 - Ponderosa Pine 4 - Cottonwood/Willow 5 - Aspen 6 - Douglas-fir 7 - Krummholz  This is a classification problem where the target could belong to any of the seven classes. Data Fields: Elevation - Elevation in meters Aspect - Aspect in degrees azimuth Slope - Slope in degrees Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology - Horz Dist to nearest surface water features Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology - Vert Dist to nearest surface water features Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways - Horz Dist to nearest roadway Hillshade_9am (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice Hillshade_Noon (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice Hillshade_3pm (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence) - Wilderness area designation Soil_Type (40 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence) - Soil Type designation Cover_Type (7 types, integers 1 to 7) - Forest Cover Type designation  Question: Given the other attributes, what will be the 'Cover_Type'? The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the Cover_Type. The test set (565892 observations) contains only the features. Assumptions: Ecology of the areas across which the data is collected is similar. Seasonal changes are constant across all the observations. The dataset is recently collected. Limitations: Environmental factors affecting the growth of any cover type is not taken into consideration. Human error while collecting data is not accounted for. Management practices that might have affected the growth is not accounted for.""}",,2

The causes still remain unclear, and different researchers have attributed this phenomenon to several factors, including topographic effect, local geological heterogeneities, wave polarization, wave trapped in fault zone and etc. This phenomenon might have severe impacts on buildings that cause damages, especially in the near-fault area. However, the current seismic design code focus on the perpendicular direction of fault strike only, which is not suitable enough for real situation. The objective of this study will focus on seismic wave directivity in near-fault zone. A total of 104 earthquake events with basic geological data were collected. Causative factors were selected based on previous research. There are three main causes considered of free field stations, included wave polarization, anisotropic stiffness and forward directivity. Data of influence factors were collected accordingly, and Arias Intensity is used to describe the directivity of seismic wave.

0,https://github.com/dyoung11/GSC-SSSENR.git,"Groundwater Seepage Calculator: Steady-State Single-Event Non-Redistribution (GSC-SSSENR). This web application utilizes steady-state sediment temperature profile to estimate groundwater seepage flux. Users are encouraged to familiarize with the theory beforehand. The only assumed parameters in the steady-state models are volumetric heat capacity of water (ρfcf) and thermal conductivity (k) of the saturated porous media. Solution of the analytical equations for steady-state conditions depends on input of values for the volumetric heat capacity of water and the thermal conductivity of sediment.  The value of the volumetric heat capacity of water will vary between 4.19x106 and 4.12x106 J/m3-°C as a function of salinity from freshwater (salinity 0 ppt) to seawater (salinity 35 ppt) at 20°C.  Sharqawy et al. (2010) provide a review of mathematical relationships that can be used to calculate values at other temperatures and salinity.  A description of the factors that influence sediment thermal conductivity has been summarized in Stonestrom and Constanz (2003).  The grain size of sediment materials and the organic matter content are two important factors that influence the value of this parameter.  Stonestrom and Constanz (2003) provided a review of measured or estimated values for a variety of porous materials and a commonly recommended default value for sediments is 1.84 J/m.s.°C.  This value is representative of a sandy sediment with little or no organic matter.  However, Duque et al (2016) have shown that use of this default value can lead to overestimation of calculated seepage flux by a factor of 30%, which can be significant in locations with seepage flux on the order of 1 cm/day or less.  Characteristics of the sediment material will be influenced by the local surficial geology, sediment depositional environment, and the presence of vegetation or other sources of organic matter.  In order to provide an updated point of reference for selection of sediment thermal conductivity for a range of depositional systems for inland and coastal environments, a review was conducted of studies where sediment thermal conductivity was measured directly or specifically optimized during model calibration.  These results are summarized in the table at left, which indicates that the common default value of 1.84 J/m.s.°C represents the high end of the distribution.  The sediment origin, type and texture descriptors listed in the table can be used to select a value that seems appropriate for the investigated water body.  Alternatively, measurements of thermal conductivity on sampled sediment cores can provide a more direct assessment of the value(s) to use for modeling.",,1
0,https://github.com/charlieInDen/EarthQuakes.git,"# Loading and Displaying a Large Data Feed  Consume data in the background, and lower memory usage by batching imports and preventing duplicate records in the Core Data store.  ## Overview This sample app shows a list of earthquakes recorded in the United States in the past 30 days by consuming a U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) real time data feed.  Press the app’s refresh button to load the USGS JSON feed on the URLSession’s default delegate queue, which is a serial operations queue running in the background. Once the feed downloads, continue working on this queue to import the large number of feed elements to the store without blocking the main queue.  ## Import Data in the Background  To import data in the background, you need two managed object contexts: a main queue context to provide data to the user interface, and a private queue context to perform the import on a background queue.   Create a main queue context by setting up your Core Data stack using [`NSPersistentContainer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcontainer), which initializes a main queue context in its [`viewContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcontainer/1640622-viewcontext) property.   ``` swift let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: ""Earthquakes"") ```  Create a private queue context by calling the persistent container’s [`newBackgroundContext()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcontainer/1640581-newbackgroundcontext) method.  ``` swift let taskContext = persistentContainer.newBackgroundContext() ```  When the feed download finishes, use the task context to consume the feed in the background. Wrap your work in a [`performAndWait()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext/1506364-performandwait) block.   ``` swift // taskContext.performAndWait runs on the URLSession\'s delegate queue // so it won’t block the main thread. taskContext.performAndWait { ```  For more information about working with concurrency, see [`NSManagedObjectContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext#1654001).  ## Update the User Interface  To show the imported data in the user interface, merge it from the private queue into the main queue.  Set the `viewContext`’s [`automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext/1845237-automaticallymergeschangesfrompa) property to `true`.  ``` swift // Merge the changes from other contexts automatically. container.viewContext.automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent = true ```  Both contexts are connected to the same [`persistentStoreCoordinator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcontainer/1640567-persistentstorecoordinator), which serves as their parent for data merging purposes. This is more efficient than merging between parent and child contexts.  When the background context saves, Core Data observes the changes to the store and merges them into the `viewContext` automatically. Then [`NSFetchedResultsController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsfetchedresultscontroller) observes changes to the `viewContext`, and updates the user interface accordingly.  Finally, dispatch any user interface state updates back to the main queue.  ``` swift dataProvider.fetchQuakes { error in     DispatchQueue.main.async {                  // Update the spinner and refresh button states.         self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem?.isEnabled = true         UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false         self.spinner.stopAnimating()          // Show an alert if there was an error.         guard let error = error else { return }         let alert = UIAlertController(title: ""Fetch quakes error!"",                                       message: error.localizedDescription,                                       preferredStyle: .alert)         alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: ""OK"", style: .default, handler: nil))         self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)     } } ```  ## Work in Batches to Lower Your Memory Footprint  Core Data caches the objects that are fetched or created in a context, to avoid a round trip to the store file when these objects are needed again. However, your app’s memory footprint grows as you import more and more objects. To avoid a low memory warning or termination by iOS, perform the import in batches and reset the context after each batch.  Split the import into batches by dividing the total number of records by your chosen batch size.  ``` swift let batchSize = 256 let count = geoJSON.quakePropertiesArray.count  // Determine the total number of batches. var numBatches = count / batchSize numBatches += count % batchSize > 0 ? 1 : 0  for batchNumber in 0 ..< numBatches {          // Determine the range for this batch.     let batchStart = batchNumber * batchSize     let batchEnd = batchStart + min(batchSize, count - batchNumber * batchSize)     let range = batchStart..<batchEnd          // Create a batch for this range from the decoded JSON.     let quakesBatch = Array(geoJSON.quakePropertiesArray[range])          // Stop the entire import if any batch is unsuccessful.     if !importOneBatch(quakesBatch, taskContext: taskContext) {         return     } } ```  Reset the context after importing each batch by calling [`reset()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext/1506807-reset).  ``` swift taskContext.reset() ```  ## Prevent Duplicate Data in the Store  Every time you refresh the feed, the data downloaded from the remote server contains all earthquake records for the past month, so it can have many duplicates of data you’ve already imported. To avoid creating duplicate records, you constrain an attribute, or combination of attributes, to be unique across all instances.   The `code` attribute uniquely identifies an earthquake record, so constraining the `Quake` entity on `code` ensures that no two stored records have the same `code` value.  Select the `Quake` entity in the data model editor. In the data model inspector, add a new constraint by clicking the + button under the Constraints list. A constraint placeholder appears.  ``` comma, separated, properties ```  Double-click the placeholder to edit it. Enter the name of the attribute (or comma-separated list of attributes) to serve as unique constraints on the entity.   ``` code ```  When saving a new record, the store now checks whether any record already exists with the same value for the constrained attribute. In the case of a conflict, an [`NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrump`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmergebypropertyobjecttrumpmergepolicy) policy comes into play, and the new record overwrites all fields in the existing record.",,1

It was based on the book Expedition, by sci-fi/fantasy artist and writer Wayne Douglas Barlowe, who was also executive producer on the special. It premiered on May 14, 2005. The show uses computer-generated imagery, which is interspersed with interviews from such notables as Stephen Hawking, George Lucas, Michio Kaku and Jack Horner. The show was filmed in Iceland and Mono Lake in California.  Darwin IV is a fictional planet 6.5 light years from the Earth, with two suns and 60% gravity. It was depicted in the series ‘Alien Planet’ based on Wayne Barlowe’s book Expedition. According to the story, after identifying Darwin IV as a world that could support life, Earth sends a pilot mission consisting of the mothership Von Braun and three probes: Balboa, Da Vinci and Newton. This unmanned fleet is responsible for finding and assessing any life forms on Darwin IV. Initially, the expectation is to find microscopic life, but the probes soon find themselves in the middle of a developed ecosystem teeming with life of all sizes. The viewer experiences Darwin IV through the eyes of the probes Ike (Newton) and Leo (Da Vinci), whose data are relayed back to the mothership and then communicated to Earth. The biological and atmospheric data from the probes and mothership are relayed to viewers through computer voice simulation and on-screen readouts. The drama on Darwin IV is motivated by real science missions, such as the NASA Origins Program and the NASA/JPL Planet-Finder Mission, as well as the European Space Agency’s Darwin Project.  Ever since watching E.T. the Extraterrestrial, aliens were one of the biggest fears I had as a child. This was because most aliens I had seen since then were those weirdly humanoid ones, which are intentionally designed to evoke the uncanny valley. This fear of being abducted by greys or Spielberg’s roasted gremlin subsided when I saw two things: Star Wars, with its light-hearted and imaginative alien life, and a 2005 documentary on Discovery Channel called Alien Planet. Especially the latter made me see the idea of alien life in a new, positive light and gave me hope that we might discover some of it one day. What young me did not realize at the time (because who reads credits anyway?) is that Alien Planet was based off a science-fiction book by painter Wayne Douglas Barlowe. In Expedition a wildlife illustrator goes on a journey to a mysterious and wild planet called Darwin IV and paints the local creatures in all their beauty while detailing his travels. This book was first published in 1990, which means that this year marks its thirtieth anniversary! To commemorate the occasion, Barlowe is now selling a reprint of the book on Echo Point Books. If you never had the chance to read it before, now is your time! Now how do I want to commemorate one of the most monumental works in speculative evolution? By playing armchair-scientist of course! One of the greatest strengths of Expedition is the great aura of mystery it not only creates but leaves behind about Darwin IV. After the first (and so far only) expedition we leave with more questions than we arrived with. This is what makes it feel almost real, as an actual first encounter with alien life would probably be just as if not more confusing. What I want to do in this post and its sequels is to seriously examine Darwin IV and the life on it in a semi-scientific way and maybe work out a few answers to its many mysteries. While I am doing this in part to put the knowledge I gained in studying Earth System Sciences to good use, my intention is also that we both learn something about real-life star systems, planets, geology and lifeforms in the process. This first post mainly concerns the orbital and geophysical characteristics of Darwin IV.",,1
