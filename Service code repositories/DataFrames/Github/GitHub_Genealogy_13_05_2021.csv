The score is an indicator of an authors eminence outside his genealogy network. This score is computed by creating a model inspired from CES production function. Model uses author-centric parameteres, NGC, NCC, OCQ, h-index and i-10 index to build a ranking mechanism to rank authors who have been working on a specific domain. Eight renowned authors from Mathematics domain with different level of expertise and contributions are selected carefully. Their genealogy and community networks are traversed and compared for testing the model. Relevant citations from their network are derived and utilized for calculating NGC, NCC and OCQ. Along with h-index and i10 index, obtained from Web of Science repository, the parameters are passed to the model for ALIS scores.",,0

The purpose of the investigation is to track last names of Encomenderos (the encomienda was an institution implemented by the Spanish conquistadors during colonization in America to take advantage of indigenous workforce) to the XVIII-XIX higher education institutions in order to prove the existence (or nonexistence) of social mobility.   We would like to use spaCy to identify the family relationships that exist between the individuals of the genealogies. I decided to write you this Email to ask you for advice on how to execute this task. So far, we have been able to extract all the names that are contained in the books. However, the Genealogies we are working are written old books and do not have a systematic way of describing family relationships (as opposed to, for example, notarial records). Because of this, we haven’t been able to figure out a way to extract these links (in most literature, authors handle historical records that describe family relationships in a more systematical way).  Any help could be very useful.  Thank you.",,0

The application would also contain a library and educational resources that everyone could use for free without any government censorship.

With this, you can artificially reconstruct a subject's DNA.This makes it a pirate. However, it does has its limits. Since it is purely based on matches, it can only reveal if you have access to the DNA of the subject's close matches. Hence, there is absolutely no risk of privacy or piracy in using the software. I named it Pirate DNA just for fun. I designed this to create artificial ancestor profiles through matches, to explore the ancestry beyond genealogical time-frame. It supports Family finder matches export file (supports only 2 - i.e., select just 1 in chromosome browser and export) and also GEDMatch's one to one match (save the output as a HTML file from browser). The more number of matches and autosomal DNA files you have matching towards a subject will increase your accuracy.""}",,0
