The primary use cases are financial (paying bills, transferring money, etc). It will open source and user hosted. People host their assistant on pre-loaded, plug and play raspberry pi 3s. Hopefully there will be a community of developers that will share integrations (ie, scraping scripts). So if I want my assistant to work with my local bank, I build an intergration and now anyone else that has the same bank can connect to it. POSADA's logic will be programmable as well. So you can customize when it alerts you, requests confirmation, or automatically transfers money from one account to another to pay a bill. One of the use cases I'm most excited about is the ability of POSADA to make donations to organization and charities you care about. So rather than setting up an auto-pay thing with a 3rd party, you tell POSADA how much you want to give, how frequently, and can even adjust the amount based on an assessment of your current financial position. The user would be in total control and I hope that will encourage more people to financial support media outlets, open source projects, and other worthy causes on a regular, sustaining basis. I've got a mobile app prototype that handles two factor authentication and will eventually grow to become the front end of the assistant. I'm currently leveraging the built in speech-to-text capabilities of android phone to allow the user to communicate with their assistant via voice.""}",,13

It is also the first cryptocurrency to be backed by sustainable assets; every ECO coin is backed by one tree. As more ecological assets are added to the system, more ECO coins become available. This also makes the ECO coin a living currency. Just as our ecology cycles through growth and decay, so too do ECO coins. ECOs coins are born, live and decay over time. The currency is governed by a Decentralised Autonomous Charity (DAC) so that not one organisation, but all those who use it have a voice in its development.

In a world ever so connected and in an era of globalization, the buzz of Bitcoin has brought to light the advantages of its underlying technology. In this context, one of many fields that could truly benefit from the Blockchain is philanthropy. Indeed, by enhancing the transparency of costs and reducing the fees of international transactions, more funds can reach the people in need more efficiently and rapidly while bringing more trust into the process. However, new technologies retrofitted to concepts that have existed long before the industrial age can present some limitations. In this paper, we tackle one of many issues that arises with respect to governance in blockchain-enabled charity organizations and propose a novel protocol for allocating voting tokens and funds and vetting projects. The protocol proposed could be fitted to any charity organization to run in a truly trustless setting while being resistant to corruption.",,1

667,https://github.com/charlotteyizhang/Dollenge.git,"Dollenge, which stands for ‚Äòdonation challenge‚Äô, is a website that taps on the concept of crowdfunding. The aim of our website is to involve users in the spirit of giving back to the society.   The main idea of our website is for people to be involved in raising funds for charity by posting a personal challenge on our website. We call these people ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù. Heroes can be anyone and the challenges can be anything. For example, Jane, an ordinary student wants to raise awareness about Cancer and hopes to raise funds for Children with Cancer UK. She is willing to shave her head for the cause. Jane, now a ‚ÄòHero‚Äô on Dollenge, can use our website to post a challenge: ‚ÄúI will shave my head if I am able to raise ¬£50,000 in 2 months‚Äô time‚Äù. Jane can share this challenge on her social media. If Jane successfully raises ¬£50,000 or more in two months‚Äô time, she can post a video or a picture of her completing her challenge.   But who else could be more influential than celebrities or well-known figures? In attempt to attract and motivate more individuals to donate, we also hope to expand our influence through engagement with celebrities. What inspired us to come up with this was mainly from the success of celebrities‚Äô influence in the ‚ÄòALS Ice Bucket Challenge‚Äô. We hope that if we are able to get them to be one of our ‚ÄòHeroes‚Äô, we could certainly raise more funds for VWOs. For instance, if Benedict Cumberbatch decides to raise funds for Save the Children by participating in a marathon, he can post a challenge on our website: ‚ÄúI will participate in Edinburgh Marathon if I am able to raise ¬£1 million in 2 months‚Äô time‚Äù. We believe that with his popularity as a famous actor, Cumberbatch can easily help VWOs to gather more funds  in a shorter period of time. We also hope that the celebrities‚Äô participation on Dollenge can help us to expand our reach on the Internet, so that more people will know about Dollenge, use Dollenge, and work together to gather more funds to help VWOs in the world.",,1
