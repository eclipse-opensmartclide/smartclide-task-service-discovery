Current pose estimation methods utilizing standard CNN architectures heavily rely on statistical postprocessing or predefined anchor poses for joint  localization.    UniPose  incorporates  contextual  seg- mentation and joint localization to estimate the human pose in  a  single  stage,  with  high  accuracy,  without  relying  on statistical postprocessing methods.   The Waterfall module in  UniPose  leverages  the  efficiency  of  progressive  filter- ing  in  the  cascade  architecture,  while  maintaining  multi- scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid config- urations. Additionally, our method is extended to UniPose- LSTM for multi-frame processing and achieves state-of-the- art results for temporal pose estimation in Video.  Our re- sults on multiple datasets demonstrate that UniPose,  with a ResNet backbone and Waterfall module, is a robust and efficient architecture for pose estimation obtaining state-of- the-art results in single person pose detection for both sin- gle images and videos.",,74

Although they demonstrate higher precision than traditional methods, they remain unable to capture fine-grained deformations. Furthermore, these methods can only be applied to a template-specific surface mesh, and is not applicable to more general meshes, like tetrahedrons and non-manifold meshes. While more general graph convolution methods can be employed, they lack performance in reconstruction precision and require higher memory usage. In this paper, we propose a non-template-specific fully convolutional mesh autoencoder for arbitrary registered mesh data. It is enabled by our novel convolution and (un)pooling operators learned with globally shared weights and locally varying coefficients which can efficiently capture the spatially varying contents presented by irregular mesh connections. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reconstruction accuracy. In addition, the latent codes of our network are fully localized thanks to the fully convolutional structure, and thus have much higher interpolation capability than many traditional 3D mesh generation models.",,46

Here, touch provides high fidelity localized information while vision provides complementary global context. However, in 3D shape reconstruction, the complementary fusion of visual and haptic modalities remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study this problem and present an effective chart-based approach to fusing vision and touch, which leverages advances in graph convolutional networks. To do so, we introduce a dataset of simulated touch and vision signals from the interaction between a robotic hand and a large array of 3D objects. Our results show that (1) leveraging both vision and touch signals consistently improves single-modality baselines, especially when the object is occluded by the hand touching it; (2) our approach outperforms alternative modality fusion methods and strongly benefits from the proposed chart-based structure; (3) reconstruction quality boosts with the number of grasps provided; and (4) the touch information not only enhances the reconstruction at the touch site but also extrapolates to its local neighborhood.",,31

You will use UCF sports action data set here http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf_sports_actions.zip. UCF Sports dataset consists of a set of actions collected from various sports which are typically featured on broadcast television channels such as the BBC and ESPN. The video sequences were obtained from a wide range of stock footage websites including BBC Motion gallery and GettyImages. The dataset includes a total of 150 sequences with the resolution of 720 x 480. The collection represents a natural pool of actions featured in a wide range of scenes and viewpoints. By releasing the data set we hope to encourage further research into this class of action recognition in unconstrained environments. Since its introduction, the dataset has been used for numerous applications such as: action recognition, action localization, and saliency detection. The dataset includes the following 10 actions. The figure above shows the a sample frame of all ten actions, along with their bounding box annotations of the humans shown in yellow.",,18

Current pose estimation methods utilizing standard CNN architectures heavily rely on statistical postprocessing or predefined anchor poses for joint  localization.    UniPose  incorporates  contextual  seg- mentation and joint localization to estimate the human pose in  a  single  stage,  with  high  accuracy,  without  relying  on statistical postprocessing methods.   The Waterfall module in  UniPose  leverages  the  efficiency  of  progressive  filter- ing  in  the  cascade  architecture,  while  maintaining  multi- scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid config- urations. Additionally, our method is extended to UniPose- LSTM for multi-frame processing and achieves state-of-the- art results for temporal pose estimation in Video.  Our re- sults on multiple datasets demonstrate that UniPose,  with a ResNet backbone and Waterfall module, is a robust and efficient architecture for pose estimation obtaining state-of- the-art results in single person pose detection for both sin- gle images and videos.",,74

Although they demonstrate higher precision than traditional methods, they remain unable to capture fine-grained deformations. Furthermore, these methods can only be applied to a template-specific surface mesh, and is not applicable to more general meshes, like tetrahedrons and non-manifold meshes. While more general graph convolution methods can be employed, they lack performance in reconstruction precision and require higher memory usage. In this paper, we propose a non-template-specific fully convolutional mesh autoencoder for arbitrary registered mesh data. It is enabled by our novel convolution and (un)pooling operators learned with globally shared weights and locally varying coefficients which can efficiently capture the spatially varying contents presented by irregular mesh connections. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reconstruction accuracy. In addition, the latent codes of our network are fully localized thanks to the fully convolutional structure, and thus have much higher interpolation capability than many traditional 3D mesh generation models.",,46

Here, touch provides high fidelity localized information while vision provides complementary global context. However, in 3D shape reconstruction, the complementary fusion of visual and haptic modalities remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study this problem and present an effective chart-based approach to fusing vision and touch, which leverages advances in graph convolutional networks. To do so, we introduce a dataset of simulated touch and vision signals from the interaction between a robotic hand and a large array of 3D objects. Our results show that (1) leveraging both vision and touch signals consistently improves single-modality baselines, especially when the object is occluded by the hand touching it; (2) our approach outperforms alternative modality fusion methods and strongly benefits from the proposed chart-based structure; (3) reconstruction quality boosts with the number of grasps provided; and (4) the touch information not only enhances the reconstruction at the touch site but also extrapolates to its local neighborhood.",,31

The video sequences were obtained from a wide range of stock footage websites including BBC Motion gallery and GettyImages. The dataset includes a total of 150 sequences with the resolution of 720 x 480. The collection represents a natural pool of actions featured in a wide range of scenes and viewpoints. By releasing the data set we hope to encourage further research into this class of action recognition in unconstrained environments. Since its introduction, the dataset has been used for numerous applications such as: action recognition, action localization, and saliency detection. The dataset includes the following 10 actions. The figure above shows the a sample frame of all ten actions, along with their bounding box annotations of the humans shown in yellow.",,18
