The map separately highlights the properties listed in the Rent Guidelines Board dataset and the NYC tax bill dataset scraped by John Krauss, allowing users to compare the accuracy of the two datasets. When users click on a property, they are provided with additional information about the property owner, the rent-stabilization programs in which the owner participates, and the number of rent-stabilized units in the building from 2007 to 2016. Users can also see the number of housing-related 311 complaints made about the property since 2015 - including those made about heat/hot water, plumbing, paint/plaster, rodents, dirty conditions, and elevators. Finally, users can filter the map to display only the properties in a particular community district.

It is a client based website which was built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The website is connected to a relational database via PHP  which inserts, reads, updates, and deletes information entered by the user from the website into the relational database. The relational database used was created for the Database Design & Development Module. Stephen Fahy G00172772 WEB SITE DESIGN 13/12/2015  The projectmain file contains all the files for my South Dublin Housing Council website.  This consists of my six html5 webpages.  There is a homepage, a tenants page, a property page, a repairs page, a tradesman page and an equipment page. Each webpage is linked to each other by a sidebar on every webpage with links to the other pages.  You enter the website via the homepage which then can access all the other webpages of the website.  In the projectmain file there is the css file whch contains the external css design for the website,  a images file which contains the images for my website, a js file which contains the javascript for the website,  and a php file which contains the php insert statements and select statements for each webpage except the homepage.  The website is linked to a database via HTML5 forms and my php code on each webpage except the homepage.  The database can be accessed by opening the south_dublin_housing_council_repairs file which contains the datafiles or  by importing the south_dublin_housing_council_repairs.sql file into your phpadmin in mysql.  The website is designed for South Dublin Housing Council's employees so that they can view and update the council's database. The employees access the website via the council's private intranet network which can be used in the main South Dublin Housing Council building in Tallaght  or in other council buildings in South Dublin. The employees access the website via the homepage which accesses the other webpages.  On the other 5 webpages employees can view the council's database or they can update it.  The majority of the website css design was done in an external css file in completesite.css. There was internal css design done in the website such as the table on the homepage using the <style> tag and  there was inline css design using the style attribute such as the paragraph on line 108 on the property webpage.  Javascript was used to add a link to googlemaps on the property page website so users could view the south Dublin area in Google maps.  Php insert and select statements were used to update and view data in the database from a website.  The php insert and select statements were used in all the pages except the homepage.  All my html5 files have been validated using w3c markup validation service.  The website is functional in all browsers but is best viewed in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.  CHANGES TO THE WEBSITE FROM THE WEBSITE DESIGN. The website design was not changed when the website was being created, but there was some slight changes made. They changes made are as follows: 1. In the property table the TENANT column was changed to TENANT_ID to have the same name has the TENANT_ID primary key in the tenant table. 2. In the property table the REPAIRS column was changed to REPAIR_ID to have the same name has the REPAIR_ID primary key in the repairs table. 3.
