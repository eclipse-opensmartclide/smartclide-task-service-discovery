570,https://github.com/GroupAYECS765P/BDP-05-Large-scale-Clustering.git,"BDP 05: CLUSTERING OF LARGE UNLABELED DATASETS  OVERVIEW Real world data is frequently unlabeled and can seem completely random. In these sort of situations, unsupervised learning techniques are a great way to find underlying patterns. This project looks at one such algorithm, KMeans clustering, which searches for boundaries separating groups of points based on their differences in some features.  The goal of the project is to implement an unsupervised clustering algorithm using a distributed computing platform. You will implement this algorithm on the stack overflow user base to find different ways the community can be divided, and investigate what causes these groupings.  The clustering algorithm must be designed in a way that is appropriate for data intensive parallel computing frameworks. Spark would be the primary choice for this project, but it could also be implemented in Hadoop MapReduce. Algorithm implementations from external libraries such as Spark MLib may not be utilised; the code must be original from the students. However, once the algorithm is completed, a comparison between your own results and that generated by MLlib could be interesting and aid your investigation.  Stack Overflow is the main dataset for this project, but alternative datasets can be adopted after consultation with the module organiser. Additionally, different clustering algorithms may be utilised, but this must be discussed and approved y the module organiser.   DATASET The project will use the Stack Overflow dataset. This dataset is located in HDFS at /data/stackoverflow The dataset for StackOverflow is a set of files containing Posts, Users, Votes, Comments, PostHistory and PostLinks. Each file contains one XML record per line. For complete schema information: Click here  In order to define the clustering use case, you must define what should be the features of each post that will be used to cluster the data. Have a look at the different fields to define your use case.   ALGORITHM The project will implement the k-means algorithm for clustering. This algorithm iteratively recomputes the location of k centroids (k is the number of clusters, defined beforehand), that aim to classify the data. Points are labelled to the closest centroid, with each iteration updating the centroids location based on all the points labelled with that value.  Spark and Map/Reduce can be utilised for implementing this problem. Spark is recommended for this task, due to its performance benefits in . However, note that the MLib extension of Spark is not allowed to be used as the primary implementation.  The group must code its own original implementation of the algorithm. However, it is possible to also use the mllib implementation, in order to evaluate the results from  each clustering implementation.  Report Contents  Brief literature survey on clustering algorithms, including the challenges on implementing them at scale for parallel frameworks. The report should then justify the chosen algorithm (if changed) and the implementation. Definition of the project use case, where the implemented project will be part of the solution. Implementation in MapReduce or Spark of a clustering algorithm(KMeans). Must take into account the potential enormous size of the dataset, and develop sensible code that will scale and efficiently use additional computing nodes. The code will also need to potentially convert the dataset from its storage format to an in-memory representation. Source code should not be included in the report. However, the algorithms should be explained in the report. Results section. Adequate figures and tables should be used to present the results. The effectiveness of the algorithm should also be shown, including performance indications. Not really sure if this can be done for clustering. Critical evaluation of the results should be provided.  Experiments demonstrating the technique can successfully group users in the dataset. Representation of the results, and discussion of the findings in a critical manner.  ASSESSMENT The project according to the specification has a base difficulty of 85/100. This means that a perfect implementation and report would get a 85. Additional technical features and experimentation would raise the difficulty in order to opt for a full 100/100 mark. Report presentation: 20% Appropriate motivation for the work. Lack of typos/grammar errors, adequate format. Clear flow and style. Related work section including  adequate referencing.  Technical merit: 50% Completeness of the implementation. [25%] Provided source code. Code is documented. [10%] Design rationale of the code is provided. [10%] Efficient, and appropriate implementation for the chosen platform. [5%] Results/Analysis: 30% Experiments have been carried out on the full dataset. [10%]  Adequate plots/tables are provided, with captions. [10%]  Results are not only presented but discussed appropriately. [10%] Additional project goals:  Implementation of additional functions beyond the base specification can raise the base mark up to 100. A non-exhaustive list of expansion ideas include: Exploration and discussion of hyperparameter tuning (e.g. the number of k groups to cluster the data into) [up to 10 marks] Comparative evaluation of clustering technique with existing implementations (e.g. mllib) [up to 10 marks] Bringing in additional datasets from stackoverflow, such as user badges, to aid in clustering [up to 5 marks] Cluster additional datasets (such as posts) [up to 10 marks] LEAD DEMONSTRATOR For specific queries related to this coursework topic, please liaise with Mr/Ms TBD, who will be the lead demonstrator for this project, as well as with the module organiser. SUBMISSION GUIDELINES The report will have a maximum length of 8 pages, not counting cover page and table of contents. The report must include motivation of the problem, brief literature survey, explanation of the selected technique, implementation details and discussion of the obtained results, and references used in the work. Additionally, the source code must be included as a separate compressed file in the submission.",,10

ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版，适合windows操作系统，比如：Xp、win7、win8、win10系统。浏览器自带翻译插件和YouTube视频下载脚本，方便且实用。压缩包文件的格式是7z，如果解压出错，用7解压软件来解压（<a href=""https://sparanoid.com/lab/7z/"" rel=""nofollow"">7z解压软件下载地址</a>）。</p> <p><strong>注意</strong>：软件都是采用加密方式的，但为了更稳定、更安全的翻墙，建议卸载国产杀毒软件，至少翻墙时不要用它们！因为很多国产杀毒软件，比如360安全卫生、360杀毒软件、腾讯管家、金山卫士等不仅仅会起干扰作用，造成软件无法正常使用或速度变慢，它们与防火墙还有千丝万缕的关系!其实win10自带的defender就有杀毒的功能，如果还需要安全软件，可以用国外的杀毒软件<a href=""http://files.avast.com/iavs9x/avast_free_antivirus_setup_offline.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">avast</a>，防火墙<a href=""https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall/releases/download/v.2.3.4/simplewall-2.3.4-setup.exe"">simplewall</a>，还有清理软件<a href=""http://downloads.wisecleaner.com/soft/WiseCare365.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">wisecare365</a>。它们都是免费的，而且不会干扰电脑运行。</p> <p><strong>选择指南</strong>：有GoProxy ipv6版、GoAgent ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版,可以按照顺序依次尝试。由于国内网络环境不同、地区不同，封锁强度会不同，所以使用效果会有差别，有的地区几乎所有的软件都能使用，有的只能用几款，因此具体哪款软件适合你的网络环境，需要你自己来尝试。内存低于2G的电脑建议用<a
