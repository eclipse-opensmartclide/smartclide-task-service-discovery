80,https://github.com/RieckyWilliams/Cyber-Security-Imperative-for-Healthcare-Industry.git,"In healthcare sector where the expenses of a treatment or the cost of a more advanced surgical instrument or machine are skyrocketing, the only thing cheap is – storing the medical histories of patients’ on electronic health records (EHRs) in the Cloud. When doctors are able to use Internet of Things for research and peer-reviewed studies, they can perform better. Diseases can be cured and prevented with facts and remedies from around the world. Telemedicine technologies can be used to provide critical medical care to people in rural and remote areas.  Such digital advancements are taking the healthcare industry into the future. However, these opportunities come with a significant security risk. In order to improve the cardiac monitoring of a patient, a lot of new medical devices can be installed, but they bring along the risk of new entry points for cyber criminals. According to the 2017 KPMG/Forbes Insights Cyber-Security Survey, 55% organizations have seen an employee falling prey to phishing scam and 34%              have seen theft from secured database by internal bad actor.  Cyber and privacy breaches bring along the risk of loss of digital assets and also cause irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization. Patient data will always remain a critical asset in the healthcare industry. However, cyber criminals are in the want of stealing this protected health information (PHI). The value of medical data is ten times more than that of financial data in the black market of dark web. In the last two years, 47% of healthcare organizations have had a security breach related to HIPAA.  Sensor-based wireless devices have proven to be a boon as well as a bane for the healthcare industry. Wireless devices allow efficient communication and seamless patient management. But they also act as an entryway into the network of the hospital. For cyber criminals this is an easy way to access sensitive information from the hospital’s networks.  Continuous technology assessments are critical to cyber security. It is imperative that healthcare organizations address all the vulnerabilities before integrating new technologies. Awareness about the potential attacks is of utmost importance.  ACS Guaranty’s Cyber-Security Solutions assist critical infrastructure organizations altering their security and privacy controls into business-enabling platforms. ACS, a Guaranteed Secured Centre safeguards IT networks and secures critical data from any cyber-attack. The company covers all the needs from pre- to post-breach in terms of cyber security. Solutions include threat intelligence, cyber forensics, and other cyber risk services.  Most common methods of attack are malware (72%), ransomware (32%) and internal theft (47%). Sharing data with third parties is on the top of perceived vulnerabilities list with 63% organizations complaining about it. Other vulnerabilities on the list include internet devices not controlled by IT (59%), external attackers (50%), and employee breaches (27%). Hence, a balanced cyber security program is required.  Healthcare organizations must implement advanced cyber security solutions, and should train and aware their staff regularly about the potential risks. Organizations ignoring this risk are vulnerable to incalculable damage to their reputation as well as their finances. ",,1

In this paper, a Blockchain based Ownership and Value Added Tax (VAT) management system has been proposed depending on a digital identity system that is implemented on blockchain technology using individuals' biometric information. The Ownership system along with VAT management was implemented using Ethereum smart contract. The experimental results of testing our system indicate that an intruder cannot perform any modification illegally to ownership data in the system. Any adversarial attempt is aborted instantly and thereby the security of citizen's ownership information is ensured. Moreover, appropriate amount of VAT is automatically assigned to the owner while changing the ownership of suitable products.

202,https://github.com/visoftwaresolutions/How-Blockchain-based-Crypto-wallets-Secures-your-online-transactions---VI-Software-Solutions.git,"{""Blockchain not only provides technology to build solutions for industries like financial services, healthcare, digital identity, digital contracts but also offers a platform for crypto wallet development and online payment solutions. Blockchain-powered crypto wallets ensure that users’ cryptocurrencies are safe from threats and hacks while enabling their exchange on different crypto trading platforms.A blockchain is a distributed database of records, or a public ledger of transactions or digital events that have been executed within the system. The premise of the underlying technology is that one centralised authority is not controlling or overseeing the transactions that take place and the record-keeping of those transactions  rather, a network of participants verifies the transaction by consensus, and once entered into the ledger, the transaction is irreversible.Blockchain is the biggest innovation in this modern business world to make the payment gateway safer for users. If we talk about blockchain wallets or a blockchain wallet application, they are designed mainly for fast and secure online payment management. It has made the payment system easier than ever. Due to this fact, the demand and popularity of the blockchain wallet development have continuously increased.    How exactly an online transaction works? It is a password protected payment method that authorizes transfer of funds over an electronic fund transfer(EFT).When you complete an online fund transaction through EFT by using your debit card with a personal identification number(PIN). When the exchange of fund is completed through EFT network, the cost of these transactions typically amounts an inter charge fee. which means a fixed percentage of your total transaction cost.  How blockchain based crypto wallets secures online payments? A blockchain wallet app consist of two keys namely public and private keys. The public key is shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret. These keys work in a very similar way to the concept of blocking and key: the block (private key) and the keys (public key).No matter how many people have the keys, they can only be useful if they are used to open the correct block, that is, the private key corresponds correctly with the public key. Once you unlock the locker, you can easily see what is stored in it. Similarly, when the private and public keys used in a transaction match, users can see the value of their digital assets (Bitcoins, ICO tokens, etc.) in their wallet. Understanding the concept of public and private keys that are on Blockchain for online payment is necessary. While the public key is available publicly for anyone, a user’s private key remains secret. These keys follow the same concept of lock and key: the lock (private key) and the keys (public key). Essentially, the private key needs to be correctly matched with the public key.When a private and a public key used in a transaction match, respective users can access the exchanged value of their digital assets (tokens) in their wallet.Based on how frequent online payment you make, you can choose between different types of blockchain wallets .    Types of blockchain based cryptocurrency wallets 1) Software wallets This type of wallet is similar to a software. Therefor you can install it on your PC and in mobile phones.It secures and controls your crypto currency transactions. 2) Web/Hosted Wallets This type of block chain wallets are like apps/platforms. mostly hosted by a third party. 3) Hardware Wallets To use hardware wallets you have to connect these wallets to an internet enabled device. How ever It is one of the safest wallet in use. It stores privet keys for users on a hardware device. Above all these type of wallets have compatibility with multiple web interfaces. So it render support for multiple crypto currencies. 4)Paper Wallets Paper wallets mostly works with software wallets for the purchase and sale of funds. The key pair ( Public and private) is induced using a software application and then printed to make a transaction process.   Various benefits of using blockchainbased crypto  wallets to secure online payments.  1) Easy fund transfer  The development of the Blockchain wallet app gained great popularity in a short time. A lot of companies have chosen this technology to make secure payments online. Most online payments are made through PayPal and bank payments, which force users to depend on the network and wait a while to complete the verification process. But after the development of the blockchain wallet application, it has released all unwanted things, such as bank charges for a transaction in the case of traditional methods. Now there are no transaction fees if you are using the Wallet Blockchain application  2) Easy to install  Since it is a blockchain wallet application for smartphones that you can easily find in an app store and can install it on your device. Therefore, choose the blockchain wallet application that suits the operating system of your mobile device and install it. In addition, you can also choose those applications that can be easily installed on both platforms, iOS and Android, for the blockchain portfolio.   3) More security It is always risky when you make online payments through the bank using the ATM PIN and password, as it carries the threat of hacking confidential data by hackers. However, due to the development of the blockchain wallet application, online payments have been protected and there is no possibility of hacking data when two parties carry out an online transaction.  Only interested persons are involved when the transaction is made through cryptocurrencies. No one knows about the payment information due to the lack of secrecy. The development of the Blockchain wallet application is necessary for the wallet to be more powerful. A combination of public and private key is required at both ends to make a transaction.  4) No  download Blockchain mobile wallets are developed by experienced developers and can be used by merchants, consumers and organizations with confidence. It is not necessary to download all transaction history in the form of a chain of blocks on your mobile device. Your blockchain wallet application automatically connects to the network and allows you to manage your Bitcoins.  5) No impact of inflation There is no impact of inflation on the development of the Blockchain wallet application. The Blockchain wallet application is an exception in case the prices of the products go up or down. The currency issued by the government will have influenced when inflation in the price of commodities. Where the Bitcoin value will not change, so you can easily perform your transaction online without confusion. Building your own blockchain portfolio is much better for online transactions where the benefit remains unique.

To know more about our services please visit: VI Software Solutions https://visoftwaresolutions.com/ PHONE NO - 9884951549 BEP2 Token Development BEP-2 is the token standard for Binance Chain, and it can be seen as the original Binance blockchain, which focuses on speedy transactions and supporting the Binance DEX. Binance Chain’s native digital asset, Binance Coin (BNB), plays a role similar to Ethereum gas. Specifically, users can pay for fees or transfers of BEP-2 tokens with BNB. Just like the vast majority of other digital tokens, BEP-2 tokens can be stored in wallets. BEP-2 has support from various hardware wallets (such as Trezor Model T, Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano X, and the Coolwallet S). This goes even further in that Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain feature certain ”cross-chain” functionality. So, what does this mean? Well, in short, it effectively means that BEP-2 tokens can be exchanged for BEP-20 token equivalents. BEP-20 Token Development BEP-20 is the token standard for the Binance Smart Chain , BEP-20 represents a token standard, just like Ethereum’s well-known, smart contract-compatible technical standard ERC-20 does. The token standard ensures basic functionality for the token, such as transferring, returning a balance, viewing token ownership, etc. BEP20\xa0is a developer-friendly token standard that allows anyone. With exorbitant Ethereum gas fees, there’s a sudden demand for a smart contract-compatible DeFi platform with lower fees. Binance Smart Chain offers just that, as well as an environment that’s comparatively easy for developers to adapt their Ethereum dApps to.  BEP-20 sets a common set of rules for token management. The BEP-20 token is also found to be compatible with the ERC-20 and BEP-2 (Token of the Binance Chain) since they’re similar. As a chain that runs parallel to Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain is specifically designed to cater to smart contracts. Binance Smart Chain is built for decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). Advantages of BEP20 Token Development     • It provides an extensible and flexible platform for developers to use this token as a blueprint and develop other tokens.     • These newly developed tokens can represent a range of things from shares, crypto assets, fiat currencies, etc.     • Another interesting feature of the BEP-20 token is that other tokens from other blockchains can be pegged on this token. In other words, developers can create other versions of crypto assets with these tokens.     • An important aspect of BEP-20 tokens is that they create a token contract on the smart chain network.     • As an incentive for those acting as validators transferring BEP-20 tokens, the BNB token is provided. It can be collected as a transaction fee, quite similar to what is observed with the BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain.  What is the difference between BEP2 and BEP20? Both BEP-2 tokens and BEP-20 tokens are fueled using Binance Coin (BNB). This stems from the fact that BEP-2 and BEP-20 are designed with “dual chain architecture”, where the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain support each other. If you created a Multicoin account, your BEP2 address would be the BNB address on your trustwallet. Your BEP20 address would be the coin called ""SmartChain"". The BEP2 address starts with ""bnb"". Your BEP20 address starts with 0x just like an Ethereum address.
