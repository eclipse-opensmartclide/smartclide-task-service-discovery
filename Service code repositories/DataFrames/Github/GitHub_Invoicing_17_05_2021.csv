This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database on the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of Pharmacy Management System is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock. Pharmacy Management system is useful to maintain correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock. It is used to manage most pharmacy related activities in the pharmacy.        Pharmacy Management System is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. Using this pharmacy management system user is also able to generate report within a specified period of time. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period. Pharmacy management system is being build. Pharmacy management system is robust, integrated technology. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly. ",,12

Introductions: Customer Lifetime Value(CLTV) ""Customer Lifetime Value is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue or profit a customer will give the company over the period of the relationship"". CLTV demonstrates the implications of acquiring long-term customers compare to short-term customers. Customer lifetime value (CLV) can help you to answers the most important questions about sales to every company:  How to Identify the most profitable customers? How can a company offer the best product and make the most money? How to segment profitable customers? How much budget need to spend to acquire customers? CLTV indicates the total revenue from the customer during the entire relationship. CLTV helps companies to focus on those potential customers who can bring in more revenue in the future.   CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency)/Churn Rate) x Profit margin.  Please check the below step for how to calculate CLTV.  Algorithm: Step1: Calculate CLTV. Calculate the average order value of customers: Average order value =  Total money spent / total number of transactions  Calculate Purchase Frequency:  Purchase Frequency = Total Number of Orders / Total Number of Customers Calculate Repeat rate and Churn rate: Repeat rate = How many customers have numbers of transactions more than one / total numbers of customers Churn rate = 1 - repeat rate Calculate the profit margin: Profit margin is the commonly used profitability ratio. It represents how much percentage of total sales has earned as the gain. Let\'s assume our business has approx 5% profit on the total sale. Profit margin = Total money spent on each customer * 0.05 Calculate customer lifetime value: Customer value = (Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency) / Churn rate Customer lifetime value = Customer value * Profit margin Step2: Predictive modelling. Build a regression model for existing customers. Take recent six-month data as independent variables and total revenue over existing time( here taking 2 years)  as a dependent variable and build a regression model on this data.  Pros and Cons of CLTV: CLTV helps you to design an effective business plan and also provide a chance to scale your business. CLTV draw meaningful customer segments these segment can help you to identify the needs of the different-different segment.  Customer Lifetime Value is a tool, not a strategy. CLTV can figure out the most profitable customers, but how you are going to make a profit from them, it depends on your strategy. Generally, CLTV models are confused and misused. Obsession with CLTV may create blinders. Companies only focus on finding the best customer group and focusing on them and repeat the business, but it’s also important to give attention to other customers.",,4
