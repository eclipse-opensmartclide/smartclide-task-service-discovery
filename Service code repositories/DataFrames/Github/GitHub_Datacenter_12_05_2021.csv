The book covers the major advancements and successes achieved in deep reinforcement learning by synergizing deep neural network architectures with reinforcement learning. The book also introduces readers to the concept of Reinforcement Learning, its advantages and why it’s gaining so much popularity. The book also discusses on MDPs, Monte Carlo tree searches, dynamic programming such as policy and value iteration, temporal difference learning such as Q-learning and SARSA. You will use TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym to build simple neural network models that learn from their own actions. You will also see how reinforcement learning algorithms play a role in games, image processing and NLP.",,1

The reason behind this is more traffic coming from online from different places. Most of these traffics are nowadays coming from populated countries. So, there is increasing demand of VPS, cloud or more dedicated resources. IN such conditions dedicated server is offered. Dedicated server has a power of dedicated CPU and RAM with a good network port speed. A network speed can give you more power when you need more traffic to balance your bandwidth. So dedicated server can be one of the best options to balance such huge load of traffic coming accidently or during some promotion period.

890,https://github.com/xiaoying-zheng/VM_Placement_anti-colocation.git,"{""One of the important problems for datacenter resource management is to place virtual machines (VMs) to physical machines (PMs) such that certain cost, profit or performance objective is optimized, subject to various constraints. In this paper, we consider an interesting and difficult VM placement problem with disk anti-colocation constraints: a VM's virtual disks should be spread out across the physical disks of its assigned PM. For solutions, we use the mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations and algorithms. However, a challenge is the potentially long computation time of the MIP algorithms. In this paper, we explore how reformulation of the problem can help to reduce the computation time. We develop two reformulations, by redefining the variables, for our VM placement problem and evaluate the computation time of all three formulations. We show that they have vastly different computation time. All three formulations can be useful, but for different problem instances. They all should be kept in the toolbox for tackling the problem. Out of the three, formulation COMB is especially flexible and versatile, and it can solve large problem instances.""}",,0

893,https://github.com/gatsoun/SensorCloudSim.git,"SensorCloudSim is a simulation platform developed by extending cloudsim, aiming to simulate sensor cloud scenarios. Sensor Cloud enables the processing of streams of data coming from sensors registered to the platform belonging to a different WSN, deployed in different geographical locations of the world. The data streamed from the sensors is then processed in the cloud and made available to applications requesting the sensor service without being aware of any hardware details of the sensor, such as its location, API etc. Sensor Cloud platform hide virtualize the sensors and provides the sensing as a service to requesting applications that also runs on the cloud, by establishing a logical connection between the sensor and the application. From what has been said previously for simulating a basic scenario in Sensor Cloud infrastructure, we should be able to specify the sensors registered to the infrastructure, the size of the streamed data to be processed in the cloud and its arrival time. As for the application, the simulator should enable us to specify the sensor it is requesting, the size of the application, since it is also requesting the cloud platform as a service and the request arrival time. because they may be several applications requesting the same sensor, the scheduling of the applications is thus necessary. The simulator should be implementing different scheduling policies and the user may choose between one of them. The main simulations results should show the performance of the scheduling chosen by the user according to some metrics such as average execution time, average waiting time, deadline met, etc. A graphical user interface would also be useful, so to allow users that don’t have java object-oriented programing notion to use the simulator. In addition to the modeling of the   cloud computing such as the data centers, the hosts in the datacenters, the virtual machines, the tasks, in addition to the allocation policy of the VM to the hosts, and of the tasks to the VMs. All of this can be modelled using SensorCloudSim infrastructure",,0
