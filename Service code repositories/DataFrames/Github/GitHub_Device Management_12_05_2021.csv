115,https://github.com/N30nHaCkZ/linux.git,"  Linux kernel release 3.x <http://kernel.org/>  These are the release notes for Linux version 3.  Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong.   WHAT IS LINUX?    Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by   Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across   the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.    It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,   including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand   loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management,   and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.    It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the   accompanying COPYING file for more details.   ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?    Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher),   today Linux also runs on (at least) the Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC and   UltraSPARC, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Hitachi SuperH, Cell,   IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, DEC VAX, AMD x86-64, AXIS CRIS,   Xtensa, Tilera TILE, AVR32 and Renesas M32R architectures.    Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures   as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of the   GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC). Linux has   also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although   functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.   Linux has also been ported to itself. You can now run the kernel as a   userspace application - this is called UserMode Linux (UML).  DOCUMENTATION:   - There is a lot of documentation available both in electronic form on    the Internet and in books, both Linux-specific and pertaining to    general UNIX questions.  I\'d recommend looking into the documentation    subdirectories on any Linux FTP site for the LDP (Linux Documentation    Project) books.  This README is not meant to be documentation on the    system: there are much better sources available.   - There are various README files in the Documentation/ subdirectory:    these typically contain kernel-specific installation notes for some     drivers for example. See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what    is contained in each file.  Please read the Changes file, as it    contains information about the problems, which may result by upgrading    your kernel.   - The Documentation/DocBook/ subdirectory contains several guides for    kernel developers and users.  These guides can be rendered in a    number of formats:  PostScript (.ps), PDF, HTML, & man-pages, among others.    After installation, ""make psdocs"", ""make pdfdocs"", ""make htmldocs"",    or ""make mandocs"" will render the documentation in the requested format.  INSTALLING the kernel source:   - If you install the full sources, put the kernel tarball in a    directory where you have permissions (eg. your home directory) and    unpack it:       gzip -cd linux-3.X.tar.gz | tar xvf -     or       bzip2 -dc linux-3.X.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -     Replace ""X"" with the version number of the latest kernel.     Do NOT use the /usr/src/linux area! This area has a (usually    incomplete) set of kernel headers that are used by the library header    files.  They should match the library, and not get messed up by    whatever the kernel-du-jour happens to be.   - You can also upgrade between 3.x releases by patching.  Patches are    distributed in the traditional gzip and the newer bzip2 format.  To    install by patching, get all the newer patch files, enter the    top level directory of the kernel source (linux-3.X) and execute:       gzip -cd ../patch-3.x.gz | patch -p1     or       bzip2 -dc ../patch-3.x.bz2 | patch -p1     Replace ""x"" for all versions bigger than the version ""X"" of your current    source tree, _in_order_, and you should be ok.  You may want to remove    the backup files (some-file-name~ or some-file-name.orig), and make sure    that there are no failed patches (some-file-name# or some-file-name.rej).    If there are, either you or I have made a mistake.     Unlike patches for the 3.x kernels, patches for the 3.x.y kernels    (also known as the -stable kernels) are not incremental but instead apply    directly to the base 3.x kernel.  For example, if your base kernel is 3.0    and you want to apply the 3.0.3 patch, you must not first apply the 3.0.1    and 3.0.2 patches. Similarly, if you are running kernel version 3.0.2 and    want to jump to 3.0.3, you must first reverse the 3.0.2 patch (that is,    patch -R) _before_ applying the 3.0.3 patch. You can read more on this in    Documentation/applying-patches.txt     Alternatively, the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this    process.  It determines the current kernel version and applies any    patches found.       linux/scripts/patch-kernel linux     The first argument in the command above is the location of the    kernel source.  Patches are applied from the current directory, but    an alternative directory can be specified as the second argument.   - Make sure you have no stale .o files and dependencies lying around:       cd linux      make mrproper     You should now have the sources correctly installed.  SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS     Compiling and running the 3.x kernels requires up-to-date    versions of various software packages.  Consult    Documentation/Changes for the minimum version numbers required    and how to get updates for these packages.  Beware that using    excessively old versions of these packages can cause indirect    errors that are very difficult to track down, so don\'t assume that    you can just update packages when obvious problems arise during    build or operation.  BUILD directory for the kernel:     When compiling the kernel, all output files will per default be    stored together with the kernel source code.    Using the option ""make O=output/dir"" allow you to specify an alternate    place for the output files (including .config).    Example:       kernel source code: /usr/src/linux-3.X      build directory:    /home/name/build/kernel     To configure and build the kernel, use:       cd /usr/src/linux-3.X      make O=/home/name/build/kernel menuconfig      make O=/home/name/build/kernel      sudo make O=/home/name/build/kernel modules_install install     Please note: If the \'O=output/dir\' option is used, then it must be    used for all invocations of make.  CONFIGURING the kernel:     Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor    version.  New configuration options are added in each release, and    odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up    as expected.  If you want to carry your existing configuration to a    new version with minimal work, use ""make oldconfig"", which will    only ask you for the answers to new questions.   - Alternative configuration commands are:       ""make config""      Plain text interface.       ""make menuconfig""  Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.       ""make nconfig""     Enhanced text based color menus.       ""make xconfig""     X windows (Qt) based configuration tool.       ""make gconfig""     X windows (Gtk) based configuration tool.       ""make oldconfig""   Default all questions based on the contents of                         your existing ./.config file and asking about                         new config symbols.       ""make silentoldconfig""                         Like above, but avoids cluttering the screen                         with questions already answered.                         Additionally updates the dependencies.       ""make olddefconfig""                         Like above, but sets new symbols to their default                         values without prompting.       ""make defconfig""   Create a ./.config file by using the default                         symbol values from either arch/$ARCH/defconfig                         or arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig,                         depending on the architecture.       ""make ${PLATFORM}_defconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by using the default                         symbol values from                         arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig.                         Use ""make help"" to get a list of all available                         platforms of your architecture.       ""make allyesconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to \'y\' as much as possible.       ""make allmodconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to \'m\' as much as possible.       ""make allnoconfig"" Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to \'n\' as much as possible.       ""make randconfig""  Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to random values.       ""make localmodconfig"" Create a config based on current config and                            loaded modules (lsmod). Disables any module                            option that is not needed for the loaded modules.                             To create a localmodconfig for another machine,                            store the lsmod of that machine into a file                            and pass it in as a LSMOD parameter.                     target$ lsmod > /tmp/mylsmod                    target$ scp /tmp/mylsmod host:/tmp                     host$ make LSMOD=/tmp/mylsmod localmodconfig                             The above also works when cross compiling.       ""make localyesconfig"" Similar to localmodconfig, except it will convert                            all module options to built in (=y) options.     You can find more information on using the Linux kernel config tools    in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig.txt.   - NOTES on ""make config"":      - Having unnecessary drivers will make the kernel bigger, and can       under some circumstances lead to problems: probing for a       nonexistent controller card may confuse your other controllers      - Compiling the kernel with ""Processor type"" set higher than 386       will result in a kernel that does NOT work on a 386.  The       kernel will detect this on bootup, and give up.      - A kernel with math-emulation compiled in will still use the       coprocessor if one is present: the math emulation will just       never get used in that case.  The kernel will be slightly larger,       but will work on different machines regardless of whether they       have a math coprocessor or not.      - The ""kernel hacking"" configuration details usually result in a       bigger or slower kernel (or both), and can even make the kernel       less stable by configuring some routines to actively try to       break bad code to find kernel problems (kmalloc()).  Thus you       should probably answer \'n\' to the questions for ""development"",       ""experimental"", or ""debugging"" features.  COMPILING the kernel:   - Make sure you have at least gcc 3.2 available.    For more information, refer to Documentation/Changes.     Please note that you can still run a.out user programs with this kernel.   - Do a ""make"" to create a compressed kernel image. It is also    possible to do ""make install"" if you have lilo installed to suit the    kernel makefiles, but you may want to check your particular lilo setup first.     To do the actual install, you have to be root, but none of the normal    build should require that. Don\'t take the name of root in vain.   - If you configured any of the parts of the kernel as `modules\', you    will also have to do ""make modules_install"".   - Verbose kernel compile/build output:     Normally, the kernel build system runs in a fairly quiet mode (but not    totally silent).  However, sometimes you or other kernel developers need    to see compile, link, or other commands exactly as they are executed.    For this, use ""verbose"" build mode.  This is done by inserting    ""V=1"" in the ""make"" command.  E.g.:       make V=1 all     To have the build system also tell the reason for the rebuild of each    target, use ""V=2"".  The default is ""V=0"".   - Keep a backup kernel handy in case something goes wrong.  This is     especially true for the development releases, since each new release    contains new code which has not been debugged.  Make sure you keep a    backup of the modules corresponding to that kernel, as well.  If you    are installing a new kernel with the same version number as your    working kernel, make a backup of your modules directory before you    do a ""make modules_install"".     Alternatively, before compiling, use the kernel config option    ""LOCALVERSION"" to append a unique suffix to the regular kernel version.    LOCALVERSION can be set in the ""General Setup"" menu.   - In order to boot your new kernel, you\'ll need to copy the kernel    image (e.g. .../linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage after compilation)    to the place where your regular bootable kernel is found.    - Booting a kernel directly from a floppy without the assistance of a    bootloader such as LILO, is no longer supported.     If you boot Linux from the hard drive, chances are you use LILO, which    uses the kernel image as specified in the file /etc/lilo.conf.  The    kernel image file is usually /vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz, /bzImage or    /boot/bzImage.  To use the new kernel, save a copy of the old image    and copy the new image over the old one.  Then, you MUST RERUN LILO    to update the loading map!! If you don\'t, you won\'t be able to boot    the new kernel image.     Reinstalling LILO is usually a matter of running /sbin/lilo.     You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to specify an entry for your    old kernel image (say, /vmlinux.old) in case the new one does not    work.  See the LILO docs for more information.      After reinstalling LILO, you should be all set.  Shutdown the system,    reboot, and enjoy!     If you ever need to change the default root device, video mode,    ramdisk size, etc.  in the kernel image, use the \'rdev\' program (or    alternatively the LILO boot options when appropriate).  No need to    recompile the kernel to change these parameters.    - Reboot with the new kernel and enjoy.   IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:   - If you have problems that seem to be due to kernel bugs, please check    the file MAINTAINERS to see if there is a particular person associated    with the part of the kernel that you are having trouble with. If there    isn\'t anyone listed there, then the second best thing is to mail    them to me (torvalds@linux-foundation.org), and possibly to any other    relevant mailing-list or to the newsgroup.   - In all bug-reports, *please* tell what kernel you are talking about,    how to duplicate the problem, and what your setup is (use your common    sense).  If the problem is new, tell me so, and if the problem is    old, please try to tell me when you first noticed it.   - If the bug results in a message like       unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000010      Oops: 0002      EIP:   0010:XXXXXXXX      eax: xxxxxxxx   ebx: xxxxxxxx   ecx: xxxxxxxx   edx: xxxxxxxx      esi: xxxxxxxx   edi: xxxxxxxx   ebp: xxxxxxxx      ds: xxxx  es: xxxx  fs: xxxx  gs: xxxx      Pid: xx, process nr: xx      xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx     or similar kernel debugging information on your screen or in your    system log, please duplicate it *exactly*.  The dump may look    incomprehensible to you, but it does contain information that may    help debugging the problem.  The text above the dump is also    important: it tells something about why the kernel dumped code (in    the above example, it\'s due to a bad kernel pointer). More information    on making sense of the dump is in Documentation/oops-tracing.txt   - If you compiled the kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS you can send the dump    as is, otherwise you will have to use the ""ksymoops"" program to make    sense of the dump (but compiling with CONFIG_KALLSYMS is usually preferred).    This utility can be downloaded from    ftp://ftp.<country>.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/ .    Alternatively, you can do the dump lookup by hand:   - In debugging dumps like the above, it helps enormously if you can    look up what the EIP value means.  The hex value as such doesn\'t help    me or anybody else very much: it will depend on your particular    kernel setup.  What you should do is take the hex value from the EIP    line (ignore the ""0010:""), and look it up in the kernel namelist to    see which kernel function contains the offending address.     To find out the kernel function name, you\'ll need to find the system    binary associated with the kernel that exhibited the symptom.  This is    the file \'linux/vmlinux\'.  To extract the namelist and match it against    the EIP from the kernel crash, do:       nm vmlinux | sort | less     This will give you a list of kernel addresses sorted in ascending    order, from which it is simple to find the function that contains the    offending address.  Note that the address given by the kernel    debugging messages will not necessarily match exactly with the    function addresses (in fact, that is very unlikely), so you can\'t    just \'grep\' the list: the list will, however, give you the starting    point of each kernel function, so by looking for the function that    has a starting address lower than the one you are searching for but    is followed by a function with a higher address you will find the one    you want.  In fact, it may be a good idea to include a bit of    ""context"" in your problem report, giving a few lines around the    interesting one.      If you for some reason cannot do the above (you have a pre-compiled    kernel image or similar), telling me as much about your setup as    possible will help.  Please read the REPORTING-BUGS document for details.   - Alternatively, you can use gdb on a running kernel. (read-only; i.e. you    cannot change values or set break points.) To do this, first compile the    kernel with -g; edit arch/i386/Makefile appropriately, then do a ""make    clean"". You\'ll also need to enable CONFIG_PROC_FS (via ""make config"").     After you\'ve rebooted with the new kernel, do ""gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore"".    You can now use all the usual gdb commands. The command to look up the    point where your system crashed is ""l *0xXXXXXXXX"". (Replace the XXXes    with the EIP value.)     gdb\'ing a non-running kernel currently fails because gdb (wrongly)    disregards the starting offset for which the kernel is compiled.",,12

128,https://github.com/geeekpi/upsplus.git,"{""UPS Plus is a new generation of UPS power management module. It is an improved version of the original UPS prototype. It has been fixed the bug that UPS could not charge and automatically power off during work time. It can not only perform good battery power management, but also provide stable voltage output and RTC functions. At the same time,it support for FCP, AFC, SFCP fast charge protocol, support BC1.2 charging protocol, support battery terminal current/voltage monitoring and support two-way monitoring of charge and discharge. It can provide programmable PVD function. Power Voltage Detector (PVD) can be used to detect if batteries voltage is below or above configured voltage. Once this function has been enabled, it will monitoring your batteries voltage, and you can control whether or not shut down Raspberry Pi via simple bash script or python script. This function will protect your batteries from damage caused by excessive discharge. It can provide Adjustable data sampling Rate. This function allows you to adjust the data sampling rate so that you can get more detailed battery information and also it will consume some power. The data sampling information can communicate with the upper computer device through the I2C protocol. UPS Plus supports the OTA firmware upgrade function. Once there is a new firmware update, it is very convenient for you to upgrade firmware for UPS Plus. The firmware upgrade can be completed only by connecting to the Internet,and execute a python script. Support battery temperature monitoring and power-down memory function. UPS Plus can be set to automatically start the Raspberry Pi after the external power comes on. The programmable shutdown and forced restart function will provide you with a remote power-off restart management method. That means you don’t need to go Unplug the power cable or press the power button to cut off the power again. You can set the program to disconnect the power supply after a few seconds after the Raspberry Pi is shut down properly. And you can also reconnect the power supply after a forced power failure to achieve a remote power-off and restart operation. Once it was setting up, you don't need to press power button to boot up your device which is very suitable for smart home application scenarios.""}",,9

We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group\'s work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff\'s exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C\'s payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo\'s Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group\'s first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C\'s auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C\'s Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We\'re now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C\'s Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C\'s Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications.

Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C\'s MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",,6

McCorduck 2004, pp. 100–101, who writes that there are ""two major branches of artificial intelligence: one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplished, and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature, particularly human ones."" Kolata 1982, a paper in Science, which describes McCarthy\'s indifference to biological models. Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing: ""This is AI, so we don\'t care if it\'s psychologically real"".[19] McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"".[20].

She writes: ""I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.""[26] ""Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized.""[27] ""Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn\'t, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.""[28] She traces the desire back to its Hellenistic roots and calls it the urge to ""forge the Gods.""[29]  ""Stephen Hawking believes AI could be mankind\'s last accomplishment"".

Once the customer’s mobile device is connected to the restaurant’s Wi-Fi connection, the Order Module will automatically show itself. The Order module allows the customers to manage and choose the food they desire and will allow them to order food without falling in-line in front of the cashier. After ordering, the system will then automatically generate a Quick- Response code that is to be scanned by the waiter/cashier. The code that was generated by the system will only last for 3 hours for it to be scanned, after 3 hours the code will be auto-canceled or expire. This is for the customers who decided to order outside or far from the restaurant. Once the code is generated, the customer can no longer edit/change his/her order. However, once the code is scanned by the cashier, the cashier can still edit the customer’s order manually.",,4

243,https://github.com/hemantupadhyay24/Geofencing-with-Task-Management.git,"{""Geofencing with Task Management is an integrated intranet system, developed for use by the faculty personnel within college, universities or offices, adapted to Smartphone's, tablets and handheld devices with the campus or university under the same LAN. Most of the colleges in India do traditional manual paperwork to maintain the records of teacher’s attendance & schedule which become burdensome. Though it works efficiently most of the time but compromises time and space. The proposed system which is based on an Android platform facilitates principal, HOD and the personnel's faculty staff throughout with the facility, regardless of the existence of network connection in the area using a typical smartphone. The proposed application and its backend system maintains access to teachers location based on Real-Time Location System (RTLS), called geofencing as well as maintaining & manipulating their timetable, checking out today’s schedule of a teacher. Additional features include editing the timetable for minor changes or import excel sheet for major changes. Also, we integrate a Quick Response (QR code) for checking the availability of the classroom using a smartphone which will help to maintain a google spreadsheet of classrooms. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the teachers as well as Head of Department to maintain their daily schedule in the best way possible. For better understanding, we have uploaded our black book references and presentation for visual understanding.""}","android,google-maps-api,geofencing,java,php,html,css,mysql,google-script",3

[1] Accordingly, they are moving beyond managing clients as simple contacts to a whole new level of client relationship management, crafting a superior commercial client experience that gives the bank a competitive advantage and a more loyal, profitable and committed customers.[1][2] Bank Management System refers to systems that enable bank customers to access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a personal computer or other intelligent device. But most of these systems do not focus on how best to manage and keep their customer’s data more secured. The chances and threats that the sector symbolizes is no longer news to the present day banking sector.[4] No traditional bank would dare face investment analysts or new customers without a complete Banking Management strategy. The main intention behind the commencement of banking services is to provide the customers with an alternative that is more responsive and with less expensive options.[3] With options more secured, customers have more control than ever.[3] Their expectations are how safe and secured their personal information would be. They also want personal attention and highly customized products and services.

Jack Diode IN 4007 General PCB Board Wires Adaptor 5V 2 Amps Relay ConnectorIntroduction:- This is IoT based home automation project is done using low cost NodeMCU module, It uses relays and few simple components, four electrical devices can be controlled, Temperature and Humidity can be monitored. NodeMCU is low cost module is used here. The electrical devices can be controlled by the help of Google assistance and by the blynk android app. In contrast, Wireless system can be of great help for automation systems. With the advancement of wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Cloud networks in the recent past, Wireless systems are used every day and every where.          FUNCTIONS OF BASIC  COMPONENTS USED: NODE MCU: NodeMCU is an open source development board and firmware based in the  widely used\xa0ESP8266 -12E Wi-Fi module With its USB-TTL ,the nodeMCU  board supports directly flashing from USB port. It combines features of WIFI  accesspoint and station + microcontroller. These features \xa0 make the NodeMCU  extremly powerful tool for Wi-Fi networking. It can be used as accesspoint and/or  station, host a webserver or connect to internet to fetch or upload data.-In our  project pins D1,D2,D7 and D8 are used to automate two lights and two fans  respectively.Pin A0 is connected to LDR.D6 is connected to DHT11 DHT11:It is a sensor which is used to sense temperature and humidity of a   particular area. LDR:It is a Light Dependent Resistor  used to sense the intensity of light.Here  we are using a  LDR which has a maximum value of 1024. Relay: A\xa0relay\xa0is an electrally operated switch. Many relays use an Electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch. Relays are used where it is  necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several  circuits must be controlled by one signal.In our project we have used  6volt  relays to control two lights and two fans respectively.    Transistor: A\xa0transistor\xa0is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.In our project we have used transistor BC547  whose base is connected to node mcu ,emitter to ground and collector to Relay. LED:In our project we have used Two LED’s one Red and one Yellow.When the circuit is on Red light glows and when we there is a online connection established  between the server and circuit yellow led glows. DC JACK: A\xa0DC connector\xa0(or\xa0DC plug, for one common type of connector) is an\xa0electrical connector\xa0for supplying\xa0direct current(DC) power. Diode: Main functions. The most common function of a\xa0diode\xa0is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the\xa0diode's\xa0forward direction), while blocking it in the opposite direction (the reverse direction).In our circuit  the positive pin of diodes are connected to  Relay. General PCB Board:In our circuit we have used PCB instead of Breadboard and we have soldered each and every connection to make the connections tight  and Errorfree.It  also makes it easier to carry. Adaptor:An adaptor is used to connect to switch boards so that it can work on fans and lights directly. Relay Connector:It is used to connect Relays       Future Scope:-  Future scope for the home automation systems involves making homes even smarter. Homes can be interfaced with the sensors including light sensor, Temperature & Humidity  Sensors and provide automated toggling of devices based on conditions. More energy  can be conserved by insuring occupation of the house before turning on devices and checking  Brightness and turning off light if not necessary. The system can be integrated  Closely with home security solutions to allow greater control & safety for home owners. The next step can be to extend this system to automate a large scale environment,  Such as offices and factories. Home automation offers a global standard for interoperable Products. Standardization enables smart homes that can control appliances, lightings, Environment, energy management and security as well as the expandability to connect with  Other networks.

310,https://github.com/andrewmogbolu2/blockchain-technology.git,"Blockchain and AI are on just about every chief information officers watchlist of game-changing technologies that stand to reshape industries. Both technologies come with immense benefits, but both also bring their own challenges for adoption. It is also fair to say that the hype surrounding these technologies individually may be unprecedented, so the thought of bringing these two ingredients together may be viewed by some as brewing a modern-day version of IT pixie dust. At the same time, there is a logical way to think about this mash-up that is both sensible and pragmatic.  Today, AI is for all intents and purposes a centralized process. An end user must have extreme faith in the central authority to produce a trusted business outcome. By decentralizing the three key elements of AI — that is, data, models, and analytics — blockchain can deliver the trust and confidence often needed for end users to fully adopt and rely on AI-based business processes. Let’s explore how blockchain is poised to enrich AI by bringing trust to data, models and analytics.  Your data is your data Many of the world’s most notable AI technology services are centralized — including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, as well as Chinese companies Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Yet all have encountered challenges in establishing trust among their eager, but somewhat cautious users. How can a business provide assurance to its users that its AI has not overstepped its bounds?  Imagine if these AI services could produce a “forensic report,” verified by a third party, to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, how and when businesses are using your data once those are ingested. Imagine further that your data could be used only if you gave permission to do so.  A blockchain ledger can be used as a digital rights management system, allowing your data to be “licensed” to the AI provider under your terms, conditions and duration. The ledger would act as an access management system storing the proofs and permission by which a business can access and use the user’s data.  Trusted AI models Consider the example of using blockchain technology as a means of providing trusted data and provenance of training models for machine learning. In this case, we’ve created a fictitious system to answer the question of whether a fruit is an apple or orange.  This question-answering system that we build is called a model, and this model is created via a process called training. The goal of training is to create an accurate model that answers our questions correctly most of the time. Of course, to train a model, we need to collect data to train on — for this example, that could be the color of the fruit (as a wavelength of light) and the sugar content (as a percentage).  With blockchain, you can track the provenance of the training data as well as see an audit trail of the evidence that led to the prediction of why a particular fruit is considered an apple versus an orange. A business can also prove that it is not “juicing up” its books by tagging fruit more often as apples, if that is the more expensive of the two fruits.  Explaining AI decisions The European Union has adopted a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies billions of dollars. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018, includes a right to obtain an explanation of decisions made by algorithms and a right to opt out of some algorithmic decisions altogether.  Massive amounts of data are being produced every second — more data than humans have the ability to assess and use as the basis for drawing conclusions. However, AI applications are capable of assessing large data sets and many variables, while learning about or connecting those variables relevant to its tasks and objectives. For this very reason, AI continues to be adopted in various industries and applications, and we are relying more and more on their outcomes. It is essential, however, that any decisions made by AI are still verified for accuracy by humans.  Blockchain can help clarify the provenance, transparency, understanding, and explanations of those outcomes and decisions. If decisions and associated data points are recorded via transactions on a blockchain, the inherent attributes of blockchain will make auditing them much simpler. Blockchain is a key technology that brings trust to transactions in a network; therefore, infusing blockchain into AI decision-making processes could be the element needed to achieve the transparency necessary to fully trust the decisions and outcomes derived from AI.  Blockchain and the Internet of Things More than a billion intelligent, connected devices are already part of today’s IoT. The expected proliferation of hundreds of billions more places us at the threshold of a transformation sweeping across the electronics industry and many other areas.  With the advancement in IoT, industries are now enabled to capture data, gain insight from the data, and make decisions based on the data. Therefore, there is a lot of “trust” in the information obtained. But the real truth of the matter is, do we really know where these data came from and should we be making decisions and transacting based on data we cannot validate?  For example, did weather data really originate from a censor in the Atlantic Ocean or did the shipping container really not exceed the agreed temperature limit? The IoT use cases are massive, but they all share the same issue with trust.  IoT with blockchain can bring real trust to captured data. The underlying idea is to give devices, at the time of their creation, an identity that can be validated and verified throughout their lifecycle with blockchain. There is great potential for IoT systems in blockchain technology capabilities that rely on device identity protocols and reputation systems. With a device identity protocol, each device can have its own blockchain public key and send encrypted challenge and response messages to other devices, thereby ensuring a device remains in control of its identity. In addition, a device with an identity can develop a reputation or history that is tracked by a blockchain.  Smart contracts represent the business logic of a blockchain network. When a transaction is proposed, these smart contracts are autonomously executed within the guidelines set by the network. In IoT networks, smart contracts can play a pivotal role by providing automated coordination and authorization for transactions and interactions. The original idea behind IoT was to surface data and gain actionable insight at the right time.  For example, smart homes are a thing of the present and most everything can be connected. In fact, with IoT, when something goes wrong, these IoT devices can even take action — for example, ordering a new part. We need a way to govern the actions taken by these devices, and smart contracts are a great way to do so.  In an ongoing experiment I have followed in Brooklyn, New York, a community is using a blockchain to record the production of solar energy and enable the purchase of excess renewable energy credits. The device itself has an identity and builds a reputation through its history of records and exchange. Through the blockchain, people can aggregate their purchasing power more easily, share the burden of maintenance, and trust that devices are recording actual solar production.  As IoT continues to evolve and its adoption continues to grow, the ability to autonomously manage devices and actions taken by devices will be essential. Blockchain and smart contracts are positioned well to integrate those capabilities into IoT.",,2

313,https://github.com/bitsenzes/how-to-make-a-successful-mobile-app.git,"{""To make a effective mobile app, one thing you need to keep in mind is:  Determine a problem which may be fixed by your app   choose the features of your app  The app should provide customer with tangible benefits including reducing costs via productivity enhancements, new earnings or enhancing the customer experience.  Step 2: Recognize To create a successful mobile app, you need to identify or be manifest about:  Application target users - An iphone app should be developed keeping in mind the target users of an application. Having a clear vision about the targeted group, enhance the success ratio of your app. Specific factors that should be considered while selecting mobile platforms and devices includes coverage, device support, performance and other features. Revenue model - The app market is booming like no time before. To be able to ensure this resource and generate earnings, app developer need to select appropriate approach in accordance with the app. You can find different models of making earnings from mobile applications including paid applications, separate application and in-app freemiums, commercials, subscription and pay for each download. These techniques can be employed to generate earnings. Direct Revenue Models - used to create successful mobile applications The graph describes a detailed account of application income models From this point you should also think about your budget, the amount of money you wish to set aside for the expansion, marketing and eventual release of your app. This a quick guide to the approximate costs for developing an app.  Action 3: Design your software designing your app to get success in software development  Designing your iphone app is yet another substantial factor in charge of success of an application on the market. An application developer must concentrate on the UI design, multi-touch gestures for touch-enabled devices and consider platform design standards as well. Today, emphasis is on the UI design of an app as it plays an essential role in the success of an app. Step 4: Determine method to develop the iphone app - native, web or cross Selecting the right approach for developing an software is highly important.Preferably, app development method must be in accordance with the time and budget limitations of any client.  Native: Native software permits in delivering the best user experience but require important some talent to be developed. These software are basically program specific and require knowledge along with knowledge. Net: Web software are quick and cheap ones to develop and can run using multiple platforms. These are developed using HTML5, WEB PAGE and JavaScript code. These types of web software are less powerful than native programs. Hybrid: Hybrid approach is the new approach to develop any application.This approach combines prebuilt local containers with on-the-fly web coding in order to achieve the best of both worlds. In this method, the developer augments the internet code with native vocabulary to create unique features and access native APIs which can be not yet available through JavaScript. Step 5: Develop a prototype after identifying the approach is developing a prototype. That is actually the taking your idea and making it an application with some basic functionality.An auto dvd unit makes it quite easier to sell your idea to would-be who can now actually see the concrete benefits rather than just imagining or reading product explanation. It is rather helpful in attracting investors and working with manufacturers and finding licensees  Step 6: Incorporate a suitable analytics tool use analytics to improve your application in order that it results in successful software development   Step seven: Identify beta-testers. Beta testing is the first possibility to get feedback from your target customers. It is particularly significant as it enhances your visibility in the iphone app store. It not only reduce product chance but ensure you get that first push in the software store. To distinguish beta testers is another important job to ensure success of an app.  Preparing for beta launch: Define focus on customer - It truly is highly important to identify and clearly define your targeted audience. This will allow you identify the right testers during your beta tester recruiting. Eliminate insects - Before beta screening your iphone app on different platforms you need to take into account vast majority of the devices which eliminate device specific insects. Identify goals - Beta testing is the best possibility to get real feedback from target customers. It provides a great chance to further understand marketplace and their requirements. Discovering goals for beta screening helps in focusing the efforts. These goals reduce your product launch chance. Step 8: Release and deploy the software Implementing an app requires plan, schedule and control over the movement of releases to test and live conditions. The objective of Deployment Management is to ensure the integrity of the live environment is protected and that the correct components are released.  Step 9: Capture the metrics There has recently been substantial rise in the mobile app users in today's decade. As a result, the need to accumulate accurate metrics is highly important. As the amount of consumers using mobile applications steadily rises, the need to gather precise metrics from them is increasingly important. Unfortunately, many of the methods used to measure programs are taken from web stats. Funnel analysis signifies why users are failing to finish desired user actions including in-app purchases or ad clicks Measuring social discussing signifies what aspects of your application are recording the interest of your users Correlating demographic data with user behaviour Step 10: Upgrade your application with improvements and new features update and upgrade your mobile after you know that you have developed it properly - the last step to successful software development  After capturing the metrics it becomes important to upgrade your app with advancements and revolutionary features. A new mobile iphone app without modern features loses its user friendliness extended range run. Upgrading your iphone app with innovative features enhances its visibility along with downloads of an app.""}",,2
314,https://github.com/soniachat8/Customer-Relationship-Management.git,"{""Customer Relationship Management: Will it sustain in the Future? “The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.” Masashi Kishimoto. Well, although that quote was made in the context of humans and our inherent capabilities, this thought can actually also be applied to anything that’s created by us. The more we learn, the better we apply. To build on that idea, let’s talk about one such small, albeit important, piece of creation – Customer Relationship Management, or simply CRM. The concept of CRM evolved from the 80s’ Rolodex devices, which were hailed for being the next-generation contact management tools at the time. After experiencing its highs and lows in the 90s and the beginning of the new millennia, CRM has grown and firmly rooted itself as an indispensable resource for businesses in the Information Age. But can it continue its run in the times to come? 1. Making sense of more and more data Most CRM software today have an efficient data collection tool embedded within themselves, which aims to recognize social patterns and make context-based decisions for the business. Markets are no longer influenced by businesses and corporate institutions; instead, it’s their entire customer base that has full control over each and every transaction. In the future, as big data becomes even more prominent, it’ll become extremely challenging for a business to analyze and make sense of the huge amount of customer data. CRM will have to build on analytical tools and make smarter decisions in order to serve a large customer base and keep them loyal. 2. Delivering a complete value package All businesses need to understand that their customers appreciate it when their queries and complaints are heard and resolved, and then some. The future of CRM has to be built on smarter data and trend analysis. Digging deeper and obtaining insight into their customers’ behavior will allow businesses to proactively create better product and service offerings, and address their needs more accurately. 3. A smarter CRM with a smarter AI As digital capabilities continue to grow, reliance on actual manpower becomes less prominent. This is essentially due to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to impart rationality to a machine and mirror the concept of ‘thought’ in them. In the same vein, as CRM becomes augmented with smarter AI, businesses are avoiding wasting precious time on the more monotonous and repetitive tasks. Along with this, the AI can make substantial studies on existing customer data and predict and deliver exact suggestions on sales and marketing activities. And it will constantly learn and re-calibrate itself to keep imparting more and more accuracy to these results, sans any human intervention. 4. Reaching business objectives efficiently At the end of the day, every business transaction is a value exchange between the company and its customer. And each business aims to maximize this value potential. Delivering an exceptional customer experience with CRM can greatly improve customer acquisition and loyalty rates, which can in turn exponentially increase the profit margins for the business. A more adept CRM can interpret market data and deliver better suggestions in a swift and productive manner.  As a CRM software keeps iterating and improving itself with the use of Artificial Intelligence, businesses can start to rely less on making uneducated decisions and come up with more meaningful strategies to engage with their customers organically. This not only fulfills the customers’ value requirements, but also makes the business more successful – a win-win situation for both the parties.""}",,2

Christof Koch doubts the possibility of ""intelligent"" machines attaining consciousness, because ""[e]ven the most sophisticated brain simulations are unlikely to produce conscious feelings."" (p. 48.) According to Koch, ""Whether machines can become sentient [is important] for ethical reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers\' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible – the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation. The alternative, embodied by IIT [Integrated Information Theory], is that computers will remain only supersophisticated machinery, ghostlike empty shells, devoid of what we value most: the feeling of life itself.""

A stumbling block to AI has been an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. An example is the ""pronoun disambiguation problem"": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence refers. (p. 61.) E McGaughey, \'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away?

Usually, this is done by companies who want their employees to stay productive and at the same time, engaged to the devices they so love to use. MDM Solutions is the best and most innovative thing happening to the industry right now. It takes the concept of working with “familiarity” and takes it to a whole new level. Mobile Device Management allows large organizations and companies to control the activities of their employees in a way that does not hinder their professional work commitment to their respective companies and organizations. Companies can execute an update in order to bring the MDM software to their employees. This works on mobile phones, smartphones, tablet computers, ruggedized mobile computers, mobile printers, etc. although, the up and coming market industry is keeping up with the latest trends and is upgrading already to laptops and desktops which also support Mobile Device Management. This change is necessary since the restriction demands vary from client to employee. Once joined into the company enterprise MDM service, the data and other paraphernalia in the employee’s personal device is protected and controlled. In this way, coordinating multiple devices with similar settings can help to protect the company and also manage the information sent over the server. It also helps to reduce costs in a variety of ways by making it work efficient.  Technological advancement is even now being conducted with the help of MDM Solutions. The main component of this technology, which consists of industry quality Mobile Device Management software, enables the clients and their companies to develop Over the Air (OTA) Programming. The Over the Air programming allows clients or companies to configure and control a single mobile device, or a large number of mobile devices, or any such device defined by the Mobile Device Management software. It can also be used to send software and OS updates. At the same time, in case of loss of mobile device or other MDM defined devices, clients and companies can remotely lock the device to prevent misuse. They can also wipe the device, thus protecting the data in it from being taken or stolen. Troubleshooting can also be done with the help of this software. Most of the time, it is possible simply with the help of an Over the Air commands sent as an SMS in binary. This type of message means that the message is in the form of a binary code.",,1

511,https://github.com/tivanni/AutomateInterfaceAddress-MultipleGroup.git,"  The script automatically configures IP addresses on network devices   The script is made for configuring networks with point-to-point connections, each interface receives a /30 address   The script assumes device\'s hostname is made by one character and one number. The character identifies the group, the number the ID of the device. NB: ID has to be between 0 and 9. Example: hostname is R1   The addresses are chosen using a convention. The four octets that made the IP address are selected in the following way   The first two octets are assigned per Group. Groups info are read from file group_addresses. Example: device R6 is in group R, group R has first two octets 172.16. If two devices have a different group,   a combinate group is made concatenating the two groups, in alphabetical order. Example: R5 is connected to S2, the group for the link is RS   The third octet is selected comparing the devices\' ID. For each connection, the two IDs are concatenated, with the smaller one in the first position. Example: connection R2 <-> R5, third octet is 25. If two devices belonging to the different groups are linked, the third octet is the ID repeated twice.   The fourth octet is selected comparing the devices\' ID as well. The device with smaller device ID has fourth octet equal to 1, the other device has the fourth octet equals to 2. If two devices belonging to different groups are linked, the fourth octet is "".1"" for the device with the lower group (groups are compared in alphabetical order)   Example: R2 interface Fa0/0 is connected to R3 interface Fa1/1. Group R has assigned address group ""172.16"". R2 Fa0/0 gets IP 172.16.23.1, R3 Fa1/1 gets ip 172.16.23.2. Example: R3 interface fa0/1 is connected to S3 interface fa1/3. The combined group is SR, SR has assigned address group ""172.100"". Re Fa0/1 gets ip 172.100.33.1, S3 Fa1/3 gets IP 172.100.33.2   Each switch has to have at least one interface with a reachable address configured (usually, a management interface). Telnet connections have to be allowed and configured. CDP has to be enabled   The hostname and the management IP address of each switch have to be specified in the file group_addresses.conf, in the form ""hostname mgmt_ip"", one device per line.   NB: cdp has to be disabled on the interface used for the management of the switch (no cdp enable)   The script is developed for Cisco 2961. FastEth 0/0 and 0/1 are L3 and shut down by default. FastEth 1/X are L2 and no shut by default   The validation phase is done via ping. The IP address on the remote side of the link is pinged using as the source address the IP on the local side of the link. The result of the ping is obtained analyzing the ""success rate"" percentage: if it is greater than 0, at least one ping was successful and the connectivity is considered to be up",,1

It provides methods to register nodes and provide the information needed to provision them and integrate them into data centers. In the current OpenHPC methodology for creating a cluster, we need to have the Mac addresses of all the compute nodes in advance and manually type in the “input.local” file. It is a time-consuming step, especially for big data centers with a massive number of compute nodes.  A baseboard management controller (BMC) is a dedicated processor inside the machine responsible for managing and monitoring the hardware layer of compute nodes, servers, or network devices. BMC performs these tasks through an individual independent connection.  IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is one of the popular traditional standards used to monitor and control the health and functionality of a system at the hardware layer.    Redfish is a new hardware-based management technology designed as the next-generation management standard.  This project aims to use IPMI and Redfish to get access to the BMC of the nodes and gather the MAC address of the selected internal interface based on the selected internal interface by the admin of the cluster. It helps to automate the process of adding nodes to a data center better than it has been.   By starting from BMC, we set all nodes to use DHCP  for their BMC addresses. And then, use the BMC to explore the Mac addresses of the interfaces and allow the user to select which will be the provisioning interface, which will be the control interfaces. The proposed method is the opposite of what we usually do: to shoot a node by knowing its mac address by manually harvesting it—then shooting the image; Once the image is up, it gets provisioned through the BMC. Our implemented method is backward. The new approach makes the new nodes auto-discovered, and you never have to write down their mac addresses manually. Therefore, the proposed method improves the automation of scaling up a cluster using hardware management tools. The tool provides two options for users. First, network discovery: it gets a range of BMC-IP addresses and checks the list of available network interfaces. It saves the information in a JSON file. Second, expanding the cluster: It gets a range of BMC-IP addresses, and based on the internal network NIC, it updates the “input.local” file by inserting the mac-addresses of nodes there.

Digital data are compressed by finding repeatable patterns of binary 0s and 1s. The more patterns can be found, the more the data can be compressed. Text can typically be compressed to approximately 40% of its original size, and graphics files from 20% to 90%. Some files compress very little. It depends entirely on the type of file and compression algorithm used.  Data compression is particularly useful in communications because it enables devices to transmit or store the same amount of data in fewer bits. There are a variety of data compression techniques, but only a few have been standardized.

529,https://github.com/watashi-Amine/Digital-Rights-Management-As-Service.git,"Preamble: DRMS,  a  digital  rights  management  provider,  aims  to  offer  digital  rights  protection  and  management as a service for multimedia Content Producers (CP). When a content is delivered to  end - users  thanks  to  a  Content  Distribution  Network  (CDN),  access  must  be  r estricted  to  legal  users  that  have  been  granted  rights.  On  one  hand,  protection  of  content  must  be  ensured  in  the  content  dissemination  chain  from  CP  to  users  going  through  CDNs.  On  the  other  hand,  DRMS  must ensure that copies of protected contents are not shared illegally among users through other  content delivery systems (e.g,. P2P networks, other Web sites, key sharing systems). Project Overview: The objective of this project is to design, implement and test a proof of concept (PoC) of  the service offer ed by DRMS. The PoC must include: (i) DRMS  site :  a  computing  and  storage  infrastructure  is  deployed  by  DRMS  to  handle  digital  rights of many contents owned by several CPs and consumed by world wide spread users. (ii) Content  Producers (At least 2):  A compu ting and storage infrastructure allows  generating  and saving original copies of content.  A subscription service allows users to book content and to  obtain a proof of their access  rights.  Information about content, legal users and legal CDNs  are  continuous ly sent to the DRMS service.   (iii) Content Distribution Networks (CDNs):  A set of content dissemination servers, which are  geographically distributed across the globe.  (iii) A P2P network: A user - to - user content dissemination network, used by malicious  users to  re - distribute illegally content to illegal users.   (iv) An emulation of a public World Wide WAN enables communication between DRMS site,  CPs,  CDNs  and  end - users.  The  latter  are  located  behind  different  access  networks  and  can  use  several devices  to access content.   (v) Emulating  legal and illegal users .",,1

When doctors are able to use Internet of Things for research and peer-reviewed studies, they can perform better. Diseases can be cured and prevented with facts and remedies from around the world. Telemedicine technologies can be used to provide critical medical care to people in rural and remote areas.  Such digital advancements are taking the healthcare industry into the future. However, these opportunities come with a significant security risk. In order to improve the cardiac monitoring of a patient, a lot of new medical devices can be installed, but they bring along the risk of new entry points for cyber criminals. According to the 2017 KPMG/Forbes Insights Cyber-Security Survey, 55% organizations have seen an employee falling prey to phishing scam and 34%              have seen theft from secured database by internal bad actor.  Cyber and privacy breaches bring along the risk of loss of digital assets and also cause irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization. Patient data will always remain a critical asset in the healthcare industry. However, cyber criminals are in the want of stealing this protected health information (PHI). The value of medical data is ten times more than that of financial data in the black market of dark web. In the last two years, 47% of healthcare organizations have had a security breach related to HIPAA.  Sensor-based wireless devices have proven to be a boon as well as a bane for the healthcare industry. Wireless devices allow efficient communication and seamless patient management. But they also act as an entryway into the network of the hospital. For cyber criminals this is an easy way to access sensitive information from the hospital’s networks.  Continuous technology assessments are critical to cyber security. It is imperative that healthcare organizations address all the vulnerabilities before integrating new technologies. Awareness about the potential attacks is of utmost importance.  ACS Guaranty’s Cyber-Security Solutions assist critical infrastructure organizations altering their security and privacy controls into business-enabling platforms. ACS, a Guaranteed Secured Centre safeguards IT networks and secures critical data from any cyber-attack. The company covers all the needs from pre- to post-breach in terms of cyber security. Solutions include threat intelligence, cyber forensics, and other cyber risk services.  Most common methods of attack are malware (72%), ransomware (32%) and internal theft (47%). Sharing data with third parties is on the top of perceived vulnerabilities list with 63% organizations complaining about it. Other vulnerabilities on the list include internet devices not controlled by IT (59%), external attackers (50%), and employee breaches (27%). Hence, a balanced cyber security program is required.  Healthcare organizations must implement advanced cyber security solutions, and should train and aware their staff regularly about the potential risks. Organizations ignoring this risk are vulnerable to incalculable damage to their reputation as well as their finances. ",,1
533,https://github.com/Deepak019/SEO.git," What is GPS? By definition, Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide network formed by a group of 24 satellites that orbit earth and transmit signals to the ground stations. These satellites were put into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defence with the intention to cater military requirements. Later, it was made available for civilian benefit. What is GPS Tracking? GPS Tracking is the technique that helps you locate a vehicle, person or an asset using the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Is GPS Tracking reliable? Immensely. GPS tracking provides you much accurate results knowing the fact that the signals have to travel thousands of kilometres across the space. GPS results may vary within few dozen feet which means that you can pinpoint whether you are at home or in the park across the street. Applications of GPS Tracking Some of the many applications are: \uf076\tCompany Fleet Management: Assists a company to manage their fleet, cut back on extra costs and improve their efficiency. \uf076\tVehicle Tracking: Keep track of your vehicle. \uf076\tChild Tracking: Know the location of your child. \uf076\tElderly people and Special People Tracking: Be with your elders or disabled loved ones in case of emergency. \uf076\tPrevention of Theft: A vehicle can be easily recovered knowing its location. There are n number of other uses from finding a friend in the market place to track your laptop while travelling. Try it to discover some more. Now, let’s come on to the most widely used application of GPS – Vehicle Tracking.   Vehicle tracking Vehicle tracking systems keep an eye on the vehicle in real time to get the full picture of all its travelled locations. Variants of Vehicle Tracking System Passive: Simpler in nature, a tracker (GPS device) is installed on the vehicle, which tracks the location of the vehicle over time. When required, the tracker is removed and data is transferred to computer for analysis and report generation. Active: Bit complex, in this variant tracker transmits the data in real time via satellite to the server. Vehicle tracking software used here evaluates the data constantly as received.  Benefits of Vehicle Tracking System Vehicle tracking system uses an integrated vehicle tracking software along with the tracker device to help you achieve the following: \uf0d8\tSurveillance – Follow your vehicle on go. \uf0d8\tMonitoring of fuel – Oversee the fuel consumption. \uf0d8\tDistance Travelled – Distance travelled by vehicle. \uf0d8\tAsset tracking – Closely monitor the valuable asset movements and its operating status. \uf0d8\tTrailer tracking – Load carrying unit of the vehicle is known as “Trailer”. Track them too! \uf0d8\tTransit Tracking – Temporary tracking of cargoes (assets) from one point to another and many more.  A number of vehicles under the single ownership or travelling together are termed as  “fleet”. So, the above benefits would multiply with the number of vehicles (fleet) and would prove to be of great advantage for fleet management companies.

535,https://github.com/atanu1982/7-Keys-to-Achieving-Compliance-Excellence---An-article-by-Charles-H.-Paul.git,"Key#1: Understand the regulations that pertain to your industry and your business throughout each level and function of your organization This is more difficult than it appears because Federal Regulations are simply not prescriptive and that is by design. 21CFR 820 Medical Device QSR for example, must be applicable to both manufacturers of small surgical instruments as well as manufacturers of MRI devices requiring that the regulations be sufficiently vague and flexible to pertain to each product.  At the end of the day, it is the responsibility of every regulated organization to interpret those governing regulations as they pertain to the company\'s unique product and processes and apply those interpretations throughout the organization. In most cases, this will require the assistance of outside industry and regulatory experts to make these interpretations and the case for the direction that the company chooses to go.  Certainly the most simplistic solution to achieving compliance excellence is ""to do the right things right!"" But what does this really mean? I have distilled the ""doing the right things right"" solution into 7 separate individual keys or actions that will provide a solid foundation for the establishment of any compliance program.  Key#2: Define your critical processes relative to the regulatory path that has been chosen. Many organizations do not adequately define their processes After choosing a regulatory path, complete and thorough process definitions that are foundational to the business must be developed and validated with linkage to the governing regulations. These process definitions are the first rung on the ladder, the ""50,000 ft. view,"" the genesis of the operational and regulatory paradigms that will form the structure of how the business will be run in an efficient, effective, and compliant manner.  Key#3: Develop sound regulatory documentation Documentation should not simply meet a regulatory requirement but be designed to effectively direct operations, be foundational to a comprehensive worker training approach, and serve as the basis for a sound continuous improvement process.    Key#4: Harmonize your processes and procedures between plants Inconsistency between operations although not necessarily a problem are cause for concern when those inconsistencies are uncovered during an inspection or investigation. Best practices should be determined for ""like"" operations, equipment, processes, etc. and then implemented across all facilities and locations where those ""like"" operations exist.  Key#5: Commit to and execute comprehensive technical training. Competence is the prerequisite to competition and compliance ""Read and Understand"" the most basic of approaches used to transfer ""knowledge and skill"" in the life sciences today simply does not work. If your goal is to just meet a regulatory requirement, this is as far as you need to go - buy an LMS, build the most basic of technical documentation, assign document readings, roll the regulatory inspection dice, and you are good to go.  If your goal, on the other hand, is to create an organization that meets or exceeds your regulatory responsibilities, demonstrates operational excellence, develops and deploys superior competence, and truly demonstrates the attributes of a learning organization, you must invest in training infrastructure, organizationally support training, provide training a seat at the operations and regulatory tables and include the function in the decision-making and advisory processes, and consistently execute an effective training process for both new and existing human resources.  Key#6: Institute a sound and effective complaint and investigations handling process : Looking at a history of 483 observations and warning letters will tell you that CAPA deficiencies uncovered during FDA investigations consistently rank in the top three of the reasons for triggering a 483 warning letter. It is essential that CAPA systems and processes be fully integrated with corporate strategies and policies and there be a commitment up and down the organizational structure to fully execute the process.  Key#7: Manage performance up and down the line to the performance structure created. If it is not managed it will not be performed Junior level managers and supervisors and the workforce in-general for that matter, must never be given cause to think that circumventing or ignoring a process or a step to a procedure is acceptable behavior even if it impacts throughput, schedules, or the ""bottom-line."" The risks to patient and end-user health and safety are simply too great. Regulatory compliance must be sacrosanct and an enforceable component of the performance management system. That message must be sent and received throughout the organization.  The intent of this approach is to demonstrate linkage between each level beginning with the regulatory requirements themselves through regulatory documentation, through the training process, ending ultimately with the management of individual human performance.....https://www.complyarena.com/articledetails/39",,1

537,https://github.com/sanusanth/c-basic-programs.git,"What is C#? C# is pronounced ""C-Sharp"".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is a modern object-oriented programming language developed in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg, the principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft. It is pronounced as ""C-Sharp,"" inspired by the musical notation “♯” which stands for a note with a slightly higher pitch. As it’s considered an incremental compilation of the C++ language, the name C “sharp” seemed most appropriate. The sharp symbol, however, has been replaced by the keyboard friendly “#” as a suffix to “C” for purposes of programming.  Although the code is very similar to C++, C# is newer and has grown fast with extensive support from Microsoft. The fact that it’s so similar to Java syntactically helps explain why it has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages today.   C# is pronounced ""C-Sharp"".  It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.  C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  An Introduction to C# Programming  C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is structured and easy to learn. It runs on Microsoft’s .Net Framework and can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms. As the syntax is simple and easy to learn, developers familiar with C, C++, or Java have found a comfort zone within C#.  C# is a boon for developers who want to build a wide range of applications on the .NET Framework—Windows applications, Web applications, and Web services—in addition to building mobile apps, Windows Store apps, and enterprise software. It is thus considered a powerful programming language and features in every developer’s cache of tools.  Although first released in 2002, when it was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0, the C# language has evolved a great deal since then. The most recent version is C# 8.0, available in preview as part of Visual Studio. To get access to all of the new language features, you would need to install the latest preview version of .NET Core 3.0.   C# is used for:  Mobile applications Desktop applications Web applications Web services Web sites Games VR Database applications And much, much more!  Why Use C#?  It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It is easy to learn and simple to use It has a huge community support C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.   The C# Environment  You need the .NET Framework and an IDE (integrated development environment) to work with the C# language.  The .NET Framework  The .NET Framework platform of the Windows OS is required to write web and desktop-based applications using not only C# but also Visual Basic and Jscript, as the platform provides language interoperability. Besides, the .Net Framework allows C# to communicate with any of the other common languages, such as C++, Jscript, COBOL, and so on.   IDEs  Microsoft provides various IDEs for C# programming:  Visual Studio 2010 (VS) Visual Studio Express Visual Web Developer Visual Studio Code (VSC)  The C# source code files can be written using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compiled using the command-line compiler of the .NET Framework.   Alternative open-source versions of the .Net Framework can work on other operating systems as well. For instance, the Mono has a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Android, BSD, iOS, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX. This brings enhanced development tools to the developer.   As C# is part of the .Net Framework platform, it has access to its enormous library of codes and components, such as Common Language Runtime (CLR), the .Net Framework Class Library, Common Language Specification, Common Type System, Metadata and Assemblies, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and LINQ.   C# and Java  C# and Java are high-level programming languages that share several similarities (as well as many differences). They are both object-oriented languages much influenced by C++. But while C# is suitable for application development in the Microsoft ecosystem from the front, Java is considered best for client-side web applications. Also, while C# has many tools for programming, Java has a larger arsenal of tools to choose from in IDEs and Text Editors.   C# is used for virtual reality projects like games, mobile, and web applications. It is built specifically for Microsoft platforms and several non-Microsoft-based operating systems, like the Mono Project that works with Linux and OS X.  Java is used for creating messaging applications and developing web-based and enterprise-based applications in open-source ecosystems.  Both C# and Java support arrays. However, each language uses them differently. In C#, arrays are a specialization of the system; in Java, they are a direct specialization of the object.   The C# programming language executes on the CLR. The source code is interpreted into bytecode, which is further compiled by the CLR. Java runs on any platform with the assistance of JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The written source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into machine code to be executed on a JRE.   C# and C++   Although C# and C++ are both C-based languages with similar code, there are some differences. For one, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language, while C++ is a partial object-oriented language. Also, while both languages are compiled languages, C# compiles to CLR and is interpreted by.NET, but C++ compiles to machine code. The size of binaries in C# is much larger than in C++.  Other differences between the two include the following:  C# gives compiler errors and warnings, but C++ doesn’t support warnings, which may cause damage to the OS. C# runs in a virtual machine for automatic memory management. C++ requires you to manage memory manually. C# can create Windows, .NET, web, desktop, and mobile applications, but not stand-alone apps. C++ can create server-side, stand-alone, and console applications as it can work directly with the hardware. C++ can be used on any platform, while C# is targeted toward Windows OS. Generally, C++ being faster than C#, the former is preferred for applications where performance is essential.    Features of C#  The C# programming language has many features that make it more useful and unique when compared to other languages, including:   Object-oriented language Being object-oriented, C# allows the creation of modular applications and reusable codes, an advantage over C++. As an object-oriented language, C# makes development and maintenance easier when project size grows. It supports all three object-oriented features: data encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  Simplicity C# is a simple language with a structured approach to problem-solving. Unsafe operations, like direct memory manipulation, are not allowed.  Speed The compilation and execution time in C# is very powerful and fast.   A Modern programming language C# programming is used for building scalable and interoperable applications with support for modern features like automatic garbage collection, error handling, debugging, and robust security. It has built-in support for a web service to be invoked from any app running on any platform.  Type-safe Arrays and objects are zero base indexed and bound checked. There is an automatic checking of the overflow of types. The C# type safety instances support robust programming.  Interoperability Language interoperability of C# maximizes code reuse for the efficiency of the development process. C# programs can work upon almost anything as a program can call out any native API.  Consistency Its unified type system enables developers to extend the type system simply and easily for consistent behavior.  Updateable C# is automatically updateable. Its versioning support enables complex frameworks to be developed and evolved.  Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.   Prerequisites for Learning C#   Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.   Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#.   Advantages of C#   There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes  Familiar syntax  Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions   Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies   As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages  It’s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes  The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn’t hang it during execution  As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform  Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage   Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless  Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps  The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C#  Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework  C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework  Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement  What Can C Sharp Do for You?  C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   C# Programming for Beginners: Introduction, Features and Applications By Simplilearn Last updated on Jan 20, 2020674 C# Programming for Beginners As a programmer, you’re motivated to master the most popular languages that will give you an edge in your career.

IDEs  Microsoft provides various IDEs for C# programming:  Visual Studio 2010 (VS) Visual Studio Express Visual Web Developer Visual Studio Code (VSC) The C# source code files can be written using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compiled using the command-line compiler of the .NET Framework.   Alternative open-source versions of the .Net Framework can work on other operating systems as well. For instance, the Mono has a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including Linux, Mac, Android, BSD, iOS, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX. This brings enhanced development tools to the developer.   As C# is part of the .Net Framework platform, it has access to its enormous library of codes and components, such as Common Language Runtime (CLR), the .Net Framework Class Library, Common Language Specification, Common Type System, Metadata and Assemblies, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and LINQ.  C# and Java  C# and Java are high-level programming languages that share several similarities (as well as many differences). They are both object-oriented languages much influenced by C++. But while C# is suitable for application development in the Microsoft ecosystem from the front, Java is considered best for client-side web applications. Also, while C# has many tools for programming, Java has a larger arsenal of tools to choose from in IDEs and Text Editors.   C# is used for virtual reality projects like games, mobile, and web applications. It is built specifically for Microsoft platforms and several non-Microsoft-based operating systems, like the Mono Project that works with Linux and OS X.  Java is used for creating messaging applications and developing web-based and enterprise-based applications in open-source ecosystems.  Both C# and Java support arrays. However, each language uses them differently. In C#, arrays are a specialization of the system; in Java, they are a direct specialization of the object.   The C# programming language executes on the CLR. The source code is interpreted into bytecode, which is further compiled by the CLR. Java runs on any platform with the assistance of JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The written source code is first compiled into bytecode and then converted into machine code to be executed on a JRE.  C# and C++   Although C# and C++ are both C-based languages with similar code, there are some differences. For one, C# is considered a component-oriented programming language, while C++ is a partial object-oriented language. Also, while both languages are compiled languages, C# compiles to CLR and is interpreted by.NET, but C++ compiles to machine code. The size of binaries in C# is much larger than in C++.  Other differences between the two include the following:  C# gives compiler errors and warnings, but C++ doesn’t support warnings, which may cause damage to the OS. C# runs in a virtual machine for automatic memory management. C++ requires you to manage memory manually. C# can create Windows, .NET, web, desktop, and mobile applications, but not stand-alone apps. C++ can create server-side, stand-alone, and console applications as it can work directly with the hardware. C++ can be used on any platform, while C# is targeted toward Windows OS. Generally, C++ being faster than C#, the former is preferred for applications where performance is essential.  Features of C# The C# programming language has many features that make it more useful and unique when compared to other languages, including:  Object-oriented language Being object-oriented, C# allows the creation of modular applications and reusable codes, an advantage over C++. As an object-oriented language, C# makes development and maintenance easier when project size grows. It supports all three object-oriented features: data encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  Simplicity C# is a simple language with a structured approach to problem-solving. Unsafe operations, like direct memory manipulation, are not allowed.  Speed The compilation and execution time in C# is very powerful and fast.   A Modern programming language C# programming is used for building scalable and interoperable applications with support for modern features like automatic garbage collection, error handling, debugging, and robust security. It has built-in support for a web service to be invoked from any app running on any platform.  Type-safe Arrays and objects are zero base indexed and bound checked. There is an automatic checking of the overflow of types. The C# type safety instances support robust programming.  Interoperability Language interoperability of C# maximizes code reuse for the efficiency of the development process. C# programs can work upon almost anything as a program can call out any native API.  Consistency Its unified type system enables developers to extend the type system simply and easily for consistent behavior.  Updateable C# is automatically updateable. Its versioning support enables complex frameworks to be developed and evolved.  Component oriented C# supports component-oriented programming through the concepts of properties, methods, events, and attributes for self-contained and self-describing components of functionality for robust and scalable applications.  Structured Programming Language The structured design and modularization in C# break a problem into parts, using functions for easy implementation to solve significant problems.  Rich Library C# has a standard library with many inbuilt functions for easy and fast development.  Full Stack Java Developer Course The Gateway to Master Web DevelopmentEXPLORE COURSEFull Stack Java Developer Course Prerequisites for Learning C#  Basic knowledge of C or C++ or any programming language or programming fundamentals.  Additionally, the OOP concept makes for a short learning curve of C#. Advantages of C#  There are many advantages to the C# language that makes it a useful programming language compared to other languages like Java, C, or C++. These include:  Being an object-oriented language, C# allows you to create modular, maintainable applications and reusable codes Familiar syntax Easy to develop as it has a rich class of libraries for smooth implementation of functions  Enhanced integration as an application written in .NET will integrate and interpret better when compared to other NET technologies  As C# runs on CLR, it makes it easy to integrate with components written in other languages It’s safe, with no data loss as there is no type-conversion so that you can write secure codes The automatic garbage collection keeps the system clean and doesn’t hang it during execution As your machine has to install the .NET Framework to run C#, it supports cross-platform Strong memory backup prevents memory leakage  Programming support of the Microsoft ecosystem makes development easy and seamless Low maintenance cost, as C# can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, which makes it easier to learn and work with C# Useful as it can develop iOS, Android, and Windows Phone native apps with the Xamarin Framework C# is the most powerful programming language for the .NET Framework Fast development as C# is open source steered by Microsoft with access to open source projects and tools on Github, and many active communities contributing to the improvement What Can C Sharp Do for You? C# can be used to develop a wide range of:  Windows client applications Windows libraries and components Windows services Web applications Native iOS and Android mobile apps Azure cloud applications and services Gaming consoles and gaming systems Video and virtual reality games Interoperability software like SharePoint Enterprise software Backend services and database programs AI and ML applications Distributed applications Hardware-level programming Virus and malware software GUI-based applications IoT devices Blockchain and distributed ledger technology   Who Should Learn the C# Programming Language and Why?  C# is one of the most popular programming languages as it can be used for a variety of applications: mobile apps, game development, and enterprise software. What’s more, the C# 8.0 version is packed with several new features and enhancements to the C# language that can change the way developers write their C# code. The most important new features available are ‘null reference types,’ enhanced ‘pattern matching,’ and ‘async streams’ that help you to write more reliable and readable code.   As you’re exposed to the fundamental programming concepts of C# in this course, you can work on projects that open the doors for you as a Full Stack Java Developer. So, upskill and master the C# language for a faster career trajectory and salary scope.",,1
