This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database on the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of Pharmacy Management System is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock. Pharmacy Management system is useful to maintain correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock. It is used to manage most pharmacy related activities in the pharmacy.        Pharmacy Management System is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. Using this pharmacy management system user is also able to generate report within a specified period of time. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period. Pharmacy management system is being build. Pharmacy management system is robust, integrated technology. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly. ",,12

India’s size and diversity makes it one of the the most disaster-prone countries in Asia. Large coastal areas in the south suffer from cyclones, while the northern mountainous areas suffer from landslides and floods, and droughts regularly affect the country’s central region. Every year, these result in a huge loss of lives, damage infrastructure, and disrupt vital services. The country’s National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) has just announced plans to build a national disaster database by 2020, which it hopes will help minimise the impact. With this natural disaster project we are able to give overall funds received to the government of Karnataka. We are to give store all the user information those able who are donating money for floods caused places.our database able to predict the cost management, proper distribution of foods medicines, cloths etc. Finally our database able to give overall money spent to all disaster caused places. In project user can also give feedback for supplied food and cloths that they have received good quality of products. Our web app will  also gives the information about migrated people so that government can easily transfer funds, medicines, foods  to the people.   A major hurdle during the design of the project was displaying the web page of the Natural Disaster Management System.  In our project we are using Django python web framework for web designing. Django is works on the principle of don’t repeat your yourself. For this database we are building dynamic web app. Since we are using python we are also able to plot graph pie charts and we are also using FusionChart. We are also using pandas for arranging data.

This paper mainly introduces the B/S architecture, focuses on Content-Based Images Retrieval technology, introduces the basic features of image low-level acquisition and corresponding retrieval matching algorithm, including graphics color, local texture and shape characteristics, the overall work summarized as follows: The main work of this paper can be divided into three parts: the first part focuses on the extraction of RGB and HSV two color space one-and three-dimensional color histogram features, and the use of Pap coefficient method and Euclidean distance method to calculate the similarity of different images; in the second part, we use the improved ""joint mode"" to obtain the texture characteristics of each part of the image by using Locality Binary Pattern. Uniform Pattern, extracting image texture features, using Euclidean distance to calculate image similarity; The third part studies the Shape feature extraction method based on image Edge Direction Histogram, the feature vectors obtained by this method satisfy the size transformation of different graphs, the translation of images and the invariant characteristics of rotation. Based on the study of the three kinds of feature extraction algorithms, this system uses the Struts2 framework based on B/S architecture, implements the different algorithms using the Java programming language, and completes the content-based image retrieval system. The System tested Image Library contains 2400 commonly used test images, which can be retrieved in the form of local uploaded images. The search conditions for the various image features described above, this article elaborated on the different characteristics of flowers, beaches, buses, elephants and other categories of image retrieval effects, and analysis of different search methods and the advantages and disadvantages of the relevant improvement methods.",,6

Or finding new viral and bacterial pneumonia (MERS, SARS, and ARDS). In Egypt, polymerise chain reaction (PCR) test takes around 48 hours to get the result, and the result isn’t always accurate and costs a lot of money in the range of 1000 – 2000, so many people can\'t afford it. Also, these tests aren\'t available in many governments so people could die for not having these tests, Also, due to the huge amount of infected people, there\'s a lack of medicine in the local pharmacies. Goals: Due to the lack of medicine, wrong clinical diagnosis by some doctors, and the enormous amount of money that the country spends on tests and medications, we decided to create a web application that uses Deep Learning and Artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze "" CT chest - Chest X-ray "" for suspected individuals and getting the results immediately and efficiently.",,4

One of the most desired tasks to be accomplished using ML applications is represented by disease detection. A good example of such a task is the detection of genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome or Hemophilia. Usually, clinicians are doing chromosome analysis using the karyotype to detect such disorders. The main contribution of the current article consists of introducing a new approach called KaryML Framework, which is extending our previous research: KarySOM: An Unsupervised Learning based Approach for Human Karyotyping using Self-Organizing Maps . Our major goal is to provide a new method for an automated karyotyping system using unsupervised techniques. Additionally, we provide computational methods for chromosome feature extraction and to develop an intelligent system designed to aid clinicians during the karyotyping process.","unsupervised-learning,karyotype,chromosomes,self-organizing-map,fuzzy-self-organizing-map,chromosomal-disorder",4

The execution fabric is fault tolerant by having all compute nodes participate in the job submission and handling process; work stealing is used to achieve efficient distributed load balancing. The fabric guarantees job execution and dependencies, and relies on an underlying scalable distributed storage system for inter-process communication (e.g. FusionFS). Data-aware scheduling maximizes data locality by scheduling computational tasks close to the data. Computations are overlapped with I/O to reduce wasted resources and hide latencies. The fabric is elastic, allowing it to grow and shrink in resource usage based on the application demand. The fabric also support compact task representation to alleviate task submission bottlenecks for common patterns (e.g. “for each x do y”). The execution fabric is integrated with several other projects, including FusionFS(a distributed file system), D^3 (direct distributed data-structure), and Swift (parallel programming system). The work will be evaluated with many applications (e.g. bioinformatics, medicine, pharmaceuticals, astronomy, physics, climate modeling, economics, and analytics) through the Swift project collaboration on the largest high-end computing (HEC) systems.",,4

Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from Yahoo finance for year 2009 to 2019. There are multiple variables in the dataset – date, open, high, low, volume. Adjusted close. The columns Open and Close represent the starting and final price at which the stock is traded on a day. High and Low represent the maximum, minimum price of the share for the day. The profit or loss calculation is usually determined by the closing price of a stock for the day, I used the adjusted closing price as the target variable. I downloaded data on the inflation rate, unemployment rate, Industrial Production Index, Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items and Real Gross Domestic Product as independent variables, Quarterly Financial Report: U.S. Corporations: Cash Dividends Charged to Retained Earnings All Manufacturing: All Nondurable Manufacturing: Chemicals: Pharmaceuticals and Medicines Industry, Producer Price Index by Industry: Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing, 30-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate, and Producer Price Index by Industry: Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing Index.  The independent variables are economic parameters which was obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website.  Methodology  1. Linear Regression: The linear regression model returns an equation that determines the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. I used linear regression tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year. The algorithm was trained with the historical data to see how the variables impact on the dependent variable. The test data was used to predict the adjusted closing price for the year and predicted a stock price of $193.38.  2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Support Vector Networks (SVN), are a popular set of supervised learning algorithms originally developed for classification (categorical target) problems and can be used for regression (numerical target) problems. SVMs are memory efficient and can address many predictor variables. This model finds the best equation of one predictor, a plane (two predictors) or a hyperplane (three or more predictors) that maximally separates the groups of records, based on a measure of distance into different groups based on the target variable. A kernel function provides the measure of distance that causes to records to be placed in the same or different groups and involves taking a function of the predictor variables to define the distance metric. I used the SVM tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year and predicted a stock price of $189.44.  3. Spline Model: The Spline Model tool was used because it provides the multivariate adaptive regression splines (or MARS) algorithm of Friedman. This statistical learning model self-determines which subset of fields best predict a target field of interest and can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between fields. I used the Spline tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year and predicted a stock price of $201.84.  The results from the models was weighted by comparing the RMSE of each model. A lower RMSE indicates that the model’s predictions were closer to the actual values. However, a simpler model with the same RMSE as a more complex model is generally better, as simpler models are less likely to be overfit. Though the Spline model had a lower RMSE, the Linear Regression model had fewer variables. Thus, we combined the 3 models with the ARIMA forecast in a model ensemble, which allows us to use the results of multiple models. The forecasted stock price is $197.99 with 1.5% increase for 31st December 2019. Apart from economic parameters, stock price is affected by the news about the company and other factors like demonetization or merger/demerger of the companies. There are certain intangible factors which can often be impossible to predict beforehand hence the model predicts that the stock price of Amgen will continue to rise except there is a drastic downturn of the company.

This movement is a way for dispensaries and shop owners to show their appreciation to their patients by donating some medication into the “CANNdy” inventory.  What is CANNdy?  CANNdy is a supply of meds that consists of strains grown specifically for CannabisCoin purchases and/or strains that can be purchased at the rate of 1 Cannabis Coin (CANN) to approx. 1 GRAM of medication.  Cannabis / Marijuana Facts  20 states in the US have legalized cannabis for medical purposes. Colorado and Washington state also permit recreational use of marijuana.  There are two very distinct groups of marijuana strains. One is cannabis; the other is hemp.  We are CANNABIS!  Cannabis is potent medicine courtesy of high amounts of CBD, medicinal terpenes, and flavonoids. It also contains varying amounts of THC. The higher the THC, the more pronounced its psychoactive effects.  What is the meaning of 420?  Straight from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  420, 4:20, or 4/20 (pronounced four-twenty) is a code-term that refers to the consumption of cannabis and by extension, as a way to identify oneself with cannabis subculture or simply cannabis itself.  Observances based on the number 420 include smoking cannabis around the time 4:20 p.m.  (with some sources also indicating 4:20 a.m.[1][2]) on any given day, as well as smoking and celebrating cannabis on the date April 20 (4/20 in U.S. form)",,2

Our webapp perform as , it search availability of medicine from all the online pharmacy as well as compare its prices. According to demand of user it sort the list i.e, from low price to high price, delivery speed etc.  FEATURES:- User can submit the medicine name with its concentration. User can also submit multiple no. of medicines as mentioned in prescription. Webapp show the best, cheapest, trustable & most suitable pharmacy in order required by the user.  MODIFICATION:-(later) We will include features of suggesting alternative medicine by reputed doctors. We will also include the supply by local pharmacy which are not on online platfrom. Also, ML/AI will be implemented to give recommendation of trustable pharmacy and medicine for common medical issues.  IDEA INTRO VIDEO LINK: - https://youtu.be/pOixsI_Az40",,1

They could have the right active ingredient but at the wrong dose. Counterfeit drugs are illegal and are harmful to health. 10% of the world's medicine is counterfeit and the problem is even worse in developing countries. Up to 30% of medicines in developing countries are counterfeit. Millions of pills, bottles and sachets of counterfeit and illegal medicines are being traded across the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to dislodge the criminal networks raking in billions of dollars from this cynical trade. Despite all these efforts, counterfeit medicine selling rackets don’t seem to stop popping here and there. It has become a challenge to deploy resources to counter these; without spreading them too thin and eventually rendering them ineffective. Government has decided that they should focus on illegal operations of high net worth first instead of trying to control all of them. In order to do that they have collected data which will help them to predict sales figures given an illegal operation's characteristics.""}",,1

The excess is usually thrown away. Our solution will help to collect these excess medicine from their homes and store them at our warehouse. It will then be redistributed to the less fortunate for free of cost.  3) Another problem we will be addressing is that usually a medicine available in one shop might not be available in another.
