This guide will benefit BI and analytics pros, data scientists, business execs and project managers. Start Download In computing, databases are sometimes classified according to their organizational approach. The most prevalent approach is the relational database, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. A distributed database is one that can be dispersed or replicated among different points in a network. An object-oriented programming database is one that is congruent with the data defined in object classes and subclasses.  Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as sales transactions, product catalogs and inventories, and customer profiles. Typically, a database manager provides users the capabilities of controlling read/write access, specifying report generation, and analyzing usage. Databases and database managers are prevalent in large mainframe systems, but are also present in smaller distributed workstation and mid-range systems such as the AS/400 and on personal computers. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for making interactive queries from and updating a database such as IBM's DB2, Microsoft's SQL Server, and database products from Oracle, Sybase, and Computer Associates.""}",,9

0,https://github.com/dtarb/GRAIP.git,The Geomorphologic Road Analysis and Inventory Package (GRAIP) software is a set of tools for analyzing the impact of roads on forested watersheds. GRAIP uses information from USFS Global Positioning System (GPS) road surveys to analyze the impacts that the construction and use of forest roads can have on geomorphic processes and erosion patterns in forested basins. It is designed to help forest managers to effectively manage road and road drainage system and hence minimize the negative impacts of forest roads. GRAIP performs the following analyses to derive information on the environmental impact of roads on forested watersheds: (1) Calculates and analyzes the production of road-based sediment and the input of that sediment into the stream network; (2)  Calculates the impact of road drainage on terrain stability and the potential for the formation of gullies due to erosion.  GRAIP is really a process for collecting the data and performing the analysis to assess forest road impacts.  The GRAIP software tools support this process.  The first generation of GRAIP tools was developed at Utah State University starting around 2005 based on USFS road inventories concieved in 2002.  This repository contains second generation GRAIP tools under development to be more platform independent and compatible with more recent GIS software (ArcGIS 10).,,8

0,https://github.com/ShadowOS/Vechicle-Routing-Problem-VRP-with-Pickup-and-Delivery.git,"Pickup-and-Delivery Problems (PDPs) constitute an important family of routing problems in which goods or passengers have to be transported from different origins to different destinations. These problems are usually defined on a graph in which vertices represent origins or destinations for the different entities (or commodities) to be transported. PDPs can be classified into three main categories according to the type of demand and route structure being considered. In many-to-many (M-M) problems, each commodity may have multiple origins and destinations and any location may be the origin or destination of multiple commodities. These problems arise, for example, in the repositioning of inventory between retail stores or in the management of bicycle or car sharing systems. One-tomany- to-one (1-M-1) problems are characterized by the presence of some commodities to be delivered from a depot to many customers and of other commodities to be collected at the customers and transported back to the depot. These have applications, for example, in the distribution of beverages and the collection of empty cans and bottles. They also arise in forward and reverse logistics systems where, in addition to delivering new products, one must plan the collection of used, defective, or obsolete products. Finally, in one-to-one (1-1) problems, each commodity has a single origin and a single destination between which it must be transported. Typical applications of these problems are less than- truckload transportation and urban courier operations.",,6
