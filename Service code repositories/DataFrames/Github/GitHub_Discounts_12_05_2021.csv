101,https://github.com/rpadma/Rappay.git,"{""My entry for ICICI Bank Hackathon 2016- Proposed a mobile app with the following functionality     1)      A bank account is at the crux of a user‚Äôs relationship with the bank. However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

139,https://github.com/mitulmanish/Java-assignments.git," You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java (SE 5.0 or later). This assignment is designed to help you: 1. Practise your knowledge of class design in Java; 2. Practise the implementation of different kinds of OO constructs in Java; 3. Practise the use of polymorphism; 4. Practise error handling in Java; 5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.  General Implementation Details \uf0b7 All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be printed to the standard output. Do not use files at all. \uf0b7 If the input is formatted incorrectly, that input should be ignored and an appropriate error message should be displayed. \uf0b7 Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes properly---i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer than 50 lines. \uf0b7 Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your coding style should be consistent with standard coding conventions \uf0b7   . Overall Specification You will build out the system from Assignment 1 to manage multiple users purchasing different types of items, including discounts for multiple items. Items to be Purchased The TechStore has been extended to sell Software as well as Books. Like Books, Software can be sold as a (physical) CD or as an online item (i.e., download). As in Assignment 1, a Book can also be sold as a physical copy or as an ebook. You need to keep track of the physical copies of Books and CDs, and whether or not a title is available as an online item. Books have a title and an author; Software items have a title and a publisher. Each item is individually priced---i.e., the price depends on the title and whether it is a physical copy or ebook/software-download. Purchasing Items A User can buy any number of items (books, software, or a mix), adding one item at a time to their Shopping Cart. However, a User can only purchase up to a total of $100, unless they are a Member‚Äîif a non-Member User tries to add an item to their Shopping Cart that takes the total over their maximum then this is blocked. A Member has no limit. Items can be added and removed from a Shopping Cart until Checkout. When an Item is added to the Shopping Cart, the system checks that there are enough copies of it available; if an Item is added or removed from the Shopping Cart, the number of copies available must be updated. Checkout clears the Shopping Cart. Users Users can add Items to their Cart, up to their allowed limit (i.e., their Shopping Cart cannot store a total greater than the limit). A User has an id (must be unique) and password (you do NOT need to make these encrypted or secure), as well as a name and email address. A Member is a special kind of user: a Member has no limit on value they can store in their Cart. Once a User has spent a total of 10% more than their limit in total (this obviously must be over multiple Checkouts), then they are offered to become a Member‚Äîthis offer is made straight after they Checkout with the items that takes them to 10% over their limit. An Administrator is a User that can perform special functions: \uf0b7 add to the number of copies of a (physical) Book or Software CD; \uf0b7 change the price of an item; \uf0b7 print sales statistics: i.e., number of sales (physical and electronic) of each Item; \uf0b7 add a new user‚Äîthe system must checked that the new id is unique. Other Users do not have these options on their menu. A user must keep track of their previous purchases, grouped by Transaction‚Äîa Transaction is the set of items purchased at Checkout time. Users can log in and out‚Äîthey do not need to Checkout before logging out. However, only one user can be logged in at a time‚Äîthe system must allow something like ‚Äúchange user‚Äù. If a User logs back in, their Shopping Cart holds the same contents as before they logged out. Recommended Items and Discounts Each item can store a list of ‚Äúif you liked this‚Äù recommendations. If a User adds an Item to their Shopping Cart, then the system suggests other titles they may like. Only similar types of things are recommended‚Äîi.e., when a Book is added, other Books (not Software) are suggested. At the time when a list of Recommended titles is given, the user has the option to add one of the recommended titles to their Shopping Cart. If a user adds the title, then they receive a discount of 15% off that second title (the first one is still full price); the User can add multiple recommended titles for 15% off each of them. If a Member adds the recommended title, then they get 25% discount off all the recommendations added. Note: when a recommended title is added, its recommendations are also shown, and are discounted if purchased at that time. You are NOT required to handle the special case of updating discounts when a User removes recommendations from their Cart. However, there is a Bonus Mark for this. Sample menus The menu for a standard User (i.e., a Shopper) should include the following options: 1. Add item to shopping cart 2. View shopping cart 3. Remove item from shopping cart 4. Checkout 5. List all items 6. Print previous purchases 7. Logout (change user) 0. Quit The menu for an Administrator should include the following options: 1. List all items (this option can include purchase statistics for each title) 2. Add copies to item 3. Change price of item 4. Add new user 5. Logout (change user) 0. Quit * SAMPLE RUNS and TEST DATA will be posted to Blackboard * Program Development When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly recommended that you build your program incrementally. This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity. Part A (2 marks): Extend Assignment 1 Start by extending your Assignment 1 solution (a sample solution will be made available): 1. Rename your main class to TechStore if necessary; 2. Extend your Book class (if necessary) to contain all data and operations it needs for Assignment 2, and appropriate classes for other types of Items to be sold; 3. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors; in particular, you must handle invalid menu options or inputs. Part B (1 marks): Class Design Define all the classes and any interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer). At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the definitions, not all the code. Part C (3 marks): Main Program Your main program should be in the TechStore class. (Of course, any class can contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program will contain a menu that offers all the required options (these can be different for different Users!). The system will allow a User to login by typing their id and password and will check that these match: if it does not then the menu prints an error; if they do match, then the system prints a welcome message with the user‚Äôs name and shows them the appropriate menu. The system must keep a list of all its Users: this list must be efficient to look-up by User id. \uf0b7 Week 7 Demo (2 marks): You will be required to demonstrate your main program and design (with only bare functionality) by Week 7 at the latest. You must also submit to the associated WebLearn project by the Week 7 lecture. Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality Implement the core functionality of the TechStore system described above, except for the recommendations, members, and discounts. You should be able to implement the rest of the TechStore functionality described above, and run and test your system. Part E (4 marks): Implement Recommendations , Members, Discounts Implement the functionality of providing recommendations, users becoming and being members, and discounts. Other (4 marks) As always, marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity, meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab assistants, or with the coding mentors. Bonus (2 marks) Note: There will be no hints or help offered on Bonus tasks. \uf0b7 1 bonus mark for early demonstration of Parts A,B,C in Week 6 \uf0b7 1 bonus mark for correctly handling removal of recommended books from Cart‚Äîe.g., if a Member removes the first item then the 15/25% should be added back to the price of the recommended title, unless there are multiple recommendations linked to that title. Submission Instructions Full assignment submission will be via Weblearn, by 9AM, Tues April 28, 2015. You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each submission will overwrite any previous submissions. 1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format). 2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Weblearn. Your progress will be taken into consideration if you need an extension. 3. There will be a separate WebLearn submission for Part A,B,C‚Äîyou must submit to this before the Week 7 lecture to qualify for the 2 marks for Week 7 demo. 4. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program, what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks. 5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission (do not submit any *.class files!). As always, your code must run on CSIT machines. 6. You must submit a single ZIP file‚Äîuse zip/WinZIP to zip your files before submitting---do NOT submit rar or zipx files!! 7. If you use packages, it is your responsibility that these unpack properly into the correct folders and that your program compiles correctly. ",,5

This results in long queues at the billing counters. This project presents an idea to develop a system in shopping malls to overcome the above problem. To achieve this all products in the mall should be equipped with RFID tags and smart check-out counter. First of all customer must login / signup with the system. When one puts any product on RFID reader its code will be detected automatically, the item name and cost will be displayed on the LCD, thereby the cost gets added to the total bill. You need to continue this process until you complete with scanning of all the products. After completion, you may generate the bill which would be mailed to your registered account and the amount will be debited from your registered credit card.

348,https://github.com/Nikkitaseth/ProjectAlpha.git,"PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API‚Äôs URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective financial statements of each company and assigned them to a variable using utils.py.  Discounted Cash Flow Model First of all, I needed to import the functions I defined in utils.py before defining the DCF model function, which would run for every company in our list. Next, I ensured to have 5 consecutive years of past data to compute the average. Thus, the first few lines of code checked whether the last year on record was 2019 from which point I would go back 5 years; if the last year was 2018, this would be taken as the first data entry from which I would go back 5 years. The second part mentioned above is important because companies file their 10-K, i.e. their annual report, at different times throughout the year so there may be companies that already filed their reports while others had not. After this step, five-year averages of every item‚Äôs percentage of revenue Ire calculated as Ill as the average revenue growth over the same period. These items included EBIT, depreciation & amortization, capital expenditures, and the change in net working capital. Once that was done, there Ire only three variables missing before calculating free cash flows for the next few years: a discount or hurdle rate; industry-specific perpetual growth rates; and a tax rate. After these three variables Ire set up, the next step was to calculate the free cash flows to the firm (fcff) for the next 5 years and determine the terminal value at the end of the period using the growth rate for the corresponding industry. For the former, I use a loop to calculate the fcff for all the year, discount it, and add it to one variable called fcffpv. Once the terminal value was calculated, these two additional numbers captured the enterprise value of the firm. Since I Ire interested in the equity value, I subtracted debt and add cash, which left us with the equity value. In one final step, I divided this value by the number of shares to end up with an intrinsic value per share. After calculating the intrinsic value per share, I compared it to the current share price with two additions. First, I added a buffer to minimize our downside risk for inaccuracy in calculations, which is called the margin of safety. Here, the intrinsic value should at least be 115% of the current share price. I also set an upper limit at 130% to ensure I would not include companies with extraordinarily high valuations, compared to their current price. If the share price calculated fell within this window, I added its ticker to a dataframe, which was the last step in the function. As such, the DCF function would run for every company and provide a dataframe with the tickers of all those companies that Ire undervalued at the time and fell within the 115% - 130% range.  Portfolio Optimization The dataframe with the tickers of all the undervalued companies that was previously created has now become the portfolio, which I converted into a list and used as the source for further optimization that is about to come. Some general inputs for the rest of the code Ire the start and end date of the data I requested for optimization, as Ill as the risk-free rate and the number of simulations I wanted to run our optimizations for. Now that the general framework has been created, it is time to choose some conditioning variables to measure the performance of investment in one sector or across a combination of some/all sectors, respectively.  Project Alpha uses the following conditioning variables to optimize its portfolios: ‚Ä¢ Sharpe Ratio: It measures the performance of an investment compared to the risk-free asset, i.e. the 10-year Treasury Bond, after adjusting for its risk factor or standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio would be given a higher Iight for investors who have a higher risk tolerance.  In terms of code, I used the bt package to retrieve the data betIen the predetermined start and end date for the companies in our ticker list. This data was then used to find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. For that, random Iights Ire assigned to each company and the ratio was computed. After running the number of simulations previously determined, the Iights with the highest Sharpe ratio will be located using loc() and labeled ‚Äòsharpe_portfolio‚Äô which is a dataframe containing the excess return, the volatility, Sharpe ratio, as Ill as the Iights for every company. I also located the portfolio with the loIst volatility, put it in a dataframe called ‚Äòmin_volatility_port‚Äô which has the same attributes. The rest of the code of this segment simply created a picture with all the portfolios generated, displaying the efficient frontier and highlighting the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio and loIst volatility. ‚Ä¢ Value at Risk (VaR): VaR was chosen as a diagnostic tool to assess the model. In our case, it basically indicated the percentage of time in which a loss greater than 1% would occur over a period of 5 years. Its limitation is that although it measures how bad the best of the bad is, it does not measure how bad it can get, meaning the worst of the worst. In regards to the code, I first requested the adjusted closing for the companies in our ticker list in the determined time horizon. I then retrieved the Iights from our Sharpe portfolio, set the number of days I wanted to simulate as Ill as the cutoff, before calculating the returns of every company in every period; here: daily. Thereafter, I created a new variable called ‚Äòsigma‚Äô, which was be a copy of our return variable, in order to ensure the right format and type for our Monte Carlo loop. The simulation is pretty straight forward, as it measures how many runs the returns fall within 1% or outside of it. I then Iighed the resulting returns by the Iight of the company in the portfolio and whenever the portfolio return was outside the set boundary, it would count as a ‚Äòbad simulation‚Äô. Once that is done, the number of bad simulations was divided by the total number of simulations to end up with a percentage of how many simulations were bad, which equals our VaR ‚Ä¢ Treynor Ratio: For the investors that already have a perfectly diversified portfolio and would like to add more assets to it, there would be a higher Iight on the Treynor ratio. It basically uses beta as a risk factor because it carries the risk relative to the market, instead of standard deviation as in Sharpe, meaning only systematic or non-diversifiable risk.  For the code, I first calculated the portfolio‚Äôs beta. For that, I defined a function ‚Äòbeta‚Äô that reads the beta of every company and returns it. The next step is to run a loop that would enter the beta of every company in our ticker list into a new dataframe. After setting the index equal to the tickers and transposing the Sharpe portfolio Iights, I can concat the two thus resulting in two columns: one is the beta of every company and the second is the corresponding Iight in the portfolio. I then created a third column as the product of columns one and two. The sum of all entries in that column is the portfolio beta, which was then used as the denominator for the ratio. The nominator was already calculated as ‚ÄòExcess Return‚Äô in the Sharpe portfolio. ‚Ä¢ Sortino Ratio: The Sortino ratio measures only the downside risk (downside deviation or semi-deviation) by measuring returns against a minimum acceptable return, ùúè. It is surprising to know that most of the industry ignores the total number of periods taken and just calculates the downside deviation by choosing the periods with downside risk, which results in misleading results. Project Alpha uses all the periods to calculate the same, so as to have an advantage over those robo-advisors/financial advisors that do not follow this process. The alpha in the future would be generated by going long on companies with high correct Sortino and low incorrect Sortino as they are undervalued, and shorting those with low correct Sortino and high incorrect Sortino as these are overvalued. The Sortino ratio would be given more Iight for investors who are more risk averse.  This part of the code started with retrieving the data for our benchmark, the S&P 500, for the period and the calculating the average daily and annual return. After that, I calculate the portfolio returns, ‚Äòreturns[‚ÄúReturns‚Äù]‚Äô, by adding the products of every company‚Äôs Iight times its return, which gave us the portfolio return for every period. From here, I calculated the downside risk by comparing the portfolio return in every period to the daily average return of our benchmark in a for loop. Before I did that, I defined a new variable called ‚Äòsemi‚Äô, which is a data series and will be filled with whatever comes out of the loop every single time. If the portfolio return minus the average daily return of the benchmark was greater than 0 ‚Äì meaning the portfolio earned more than the average of the S&P500 ‚Äì the value for the period was set to 0 and added to the semi data series. If it is 0, which is extremely unlikely, but whatever, it would also be 0. If it is less than 0, hoIver, which indicates underperformance, I would square the portfolio return, which already gives us the semi variance I need for our next step. From here, I can simply take the square root of the average of the ‚Äòsemi‚Äô data series to get the daily downside risk and multiplying it by the square root of 252, which gives us the annual number. After that, I have all the numbers to calculate the Sortino ratio. ‚Ä¢ Information Ratio: The information ratio measures the portfolio returns compared to the returns of a benchmark index, i.e. S&P500, after adjusting for its additional risk. It only looks at the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark and the volatility or risk associated with it. I already have all the inputs I need to calculate his ratio. Thus, I simply created a new dataframe with the portfolio returns of every period and the benchmark returns of every period. To find the excess return, i.e. the nominator, I simply subtracted the latter from the former and assigned it to a new variable, which I called ‚Äòexcess_return‚Äô. The nominator would be the average return of the portfolio minus the average return of the benchmark, and the denominator would be the standard deviation of the ‚Äòexcess_return‚Äô series. Finally, I printed short sentences with the results for every conditioning variable just described as an output in the console.",,2

350,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script.git,"Contact : flokif418@gmail.com  About script  Marketplace v2.0 is also written in PHP with Laravel framework. Its using latest standards for encryption (like Sodium library) and security. Its made without use of JavaScript, so its optimized for TOR, but can also be ran normally like any other web app (as you can see on demo).  \xa0  Requirements  VPS with at least 2GB of RAM  Daemon for each coin that is enabled on marketplace  Server requirements:\xa0(what software is needed on VPS)  PHP 7 (recommended and tested on 7.2)  SQL Database (MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)  Elasticsearch (Search interface that will keep track of search records and provide great search performance)  Redis (Optional, but will greatly increase app performance )   \xa0Features  Categories Category system is very dynamic. Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders\xa0completed\xa0most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user‚Äôs PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user‚Äôs choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is ‚ÄúAdd to wishlist‚Äù button that can be used, and they are stored in user‚Äôs personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:  \xa0 \xa0‚Äòmultipliers‚Äô => [ ‚Äòproduct_delivered‚Äô => 10, ‚Äòproduct_dispute_lost‚Äô =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_star‚Äô => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_usd‚Äô => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece ‚Ä¶). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product‚Äôs quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin‚Äôs decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography\xa0(like\xa0XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF)\xa0to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user‚Äôs password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B‚Äôs public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don‚Äôt need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index ‚Äì Basic information  Categories ‚Äì Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages ‚Äì Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users ‚Äì View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products ‚Äì View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log ‚Äì Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage ‚Äì Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes ‚Äì View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets ‚Äì View and resolve support tickets  Purchases ‚Äì List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases ‚Äì List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin ‚Äì Included in standard version  Monero ‚Äì Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included.

However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

735,https://github.com/mitulmanish/Java-assignments.git," You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java (SE 5.0 or later). This assignment is designed to help you: 1. Practise your knowledge of class design in Java; 2. Practise the implementation of different kinds of OO constructs in Java; 3. Practise the use of polymorphism; 4. Practise error handling in Java; 5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.  General Implementation Details \uf0b7 All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be printed to the standard output. Do not use files at all. \uf0b7 If the input is formatted incorrectly, that input should be ignored and an appropriate error message should be displayed. \uf0b7 Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes properly---i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer than 50 lines. \uf0b7 Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your coding style should be consistent with standard coding conventions \uf0b7   . Overall Specification You will build out the system from Assignment 1 to manage multiple users purchasing different types of items, including discounts for multiple items. Items to be Purchased The TechStore has been extended to sell Software as well as Books. Like Books, Software can be sold as a (physical) CD or as an online item (i.e., download). As in Assignment 1, a Book can also be sold as a physical copy or as an ebook. You need to keep track of the physical copies of Books and CDs, and whether or not a title is available as an online item. Books have a title and an author; Software items have a title and a publisher. Each item is individually priced---i.e., the price depends on the title and whether it is a physical copy or ebook/software-download. Purchasing Items A User can buy any number of items (books, software, or a mix), adding one item at a time to their Shopping Cart. However, a User can only purchase up to a total of $100, unless they are a Member‚Äîif a non-Member User tries to add an item to their Shopping Cart that takes the total over their maximum then this is blocked. A Member has no limit. Items can be added and removed from a Shopping Cart until Checkout. When an Item is added to the Shopping Cart, the system checks that there are enough copies of it available; if an Item is added or removed from the Shopping Cart, the number of copies available must be updated. Checkout clears the Shopping Cart. Users Users can add Items to their Cart, up to their allowed limit (i.e., their Shopping Cart cannot store a total greater than the limit). A User has an id (must be unique) and password (you do NOT need to make these encrypted or secure), as well as a name and email address. A Member is a special kind of user: a Member has no limit on value they can store in their Cart. Once a User has spent a total of 10% more than their limit in total (this obviously must be over multiple Checkouts), then they are offered to become a Member‚Äîthis offer is made straight after they Checkout with the items that takes them to 10% over their limit. An Administrator is a User that can perform special functions: \uf0b7 add to the number of copies of a (physical) Book or Software CD; \uf0b7 change the price of an item; \uf0b7 print sales statistics: i.e., number of sales (physical and electronic) of each Item; \uf0b7 add a new user‚Äîthe system must checked that the new id is unique. Other Users do not have these options on their menu. A user must keep track of their previous purchases, grouped by Transaction‚Äîa Transaction is the set of items purchased at Checkout time. Users can log in and out‚Äîthey do not need to Checkout before logging out. However, only one user can be logged in at a time‚Äîthe system must allow something like ‚Äúchange user‚Äù. If a User logs back in, their Shopping Cart holds the same contents as before they logged out. Recommended Items and Discounts Each item can store a list of ‚Äúif you liked this‚Äù recommendations. If a User adds an Item to their Shopping Cart, then the system suggests other titles they may like. Only similar types of things are recommended‚Äîi.e., when a Book is added, other Books (not Software) are suggested. At the time when a list of Recommended titles is given, the user has the option to add one of the recommended titles to their Shopping Cart. If a user adds the title, then they receive a discount of 15% off that second title (the first one is still full price); the User can add multiple recommended titles for 15% off each of them. If a Member adds the recommended title, then they get 25% discount off all the recommendations added. Note: when a recommended title is added, its recommendations are also shown, and are discounted if purchased at that time. You are NOT required to handle the special case of updating discounts when a User removes recommendations from their Cart. However, there is a Bonus Mark for this. Sample menus The menu for a standard User (i.e., a Shopper) should include the following options: 1. Add item to shopping cart 2. View shopping cart 3. Remove item from shopping cart 4. Checkout 5. List all items 6. Print previous purchases 7. Logout (change user) 0. Quit The menu for an Administrator should include the following options: 1. List all items (this option can include purchase statistics for each title) 2. Add copies to item 3. Change price of item 4. Add new user 5. Logout (change user) 0. Quit * SAMPLE RUNS and TEST DATA will be posted to Blackboard * Program Development When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly recommended that you build your program incrementally. This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity. Part A (2 marks): Extend Assignment 1 Start by extending your Assignment 1 solution (a sample solution will be made available): 1. Rename your main class to TechStore if necessary; 2. Extend your Book class (if necessary) to contain all data and operations it needs for Assignment 2, and appropriate classes for other types of Items to be sold; 3. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors; in particular, you must handle invalid menu options or inputs. Part B (1 marks): Class Design Define all the classes and any interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer). At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the definitions, not all the code. Part C (3 marks): Main Program Your main program should be in the TechStore class. (Of course, any class can contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program will contain a menu that offers all the required options (these can be different for different Users!). The system will allow a User to login by typing their id and password and will check that these match: if it does not then the menu prints an error; if they do match, then the system prints a welcome message with the user‚Äôs name and shows them the appropriate menu. The system must keep a list of all its Users: this list must be efficient to look-up by User id. \uf0b7 Week 7 Demo (2 marks): You will be required to demonstrate your main program and design (with only bare functionality) by Week 7 at the latest. You must also submit to the associated WebLearn project by the Week 7 lecture. Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality Implement the core functionality of the TechStore system described above, except for the recommendations, members, and discounts. You should be able to implement the rest of the TechStore functionality described above, and run and test your system. Part E (4 marks): Implement Recommendations , Members, Discounts Implement the functionality of providing recommendations, users becoming and being members, and discounts. Other (4 marks) As always, marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity, meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab assistants, or with the coding mentors. Bonus (2 marks) Note: There will be no hints or help offered on Bonus tasks. \uf0b7 1 bonus mark for early demonstration of Parts A,B,C in Week 6 \uf0b7 1 bonus mark for correctly handling removal of recommended books from Cart‚Äîe.g., if a Member removes the first item then the 15/25% should be added back to the price of the recommended title, unless there are multiple recommendations linked to that title. Submission Instructions Full assignment submission will be via Weblearn, by 9AM, Tues April 28, 2015. You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each submission will overwrite any previous submissions. 1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format). 2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Weblearn. Your progress will be taken into consideration if you need an extension. 3. There will be a separate WebLearn submission for Part A,B,C‚Äîyou must submit to this before the Week 7 lecture to qualify for the 2 marks for Week 7 demo. 4. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program, what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks. 5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission (do not submit any *.class files!). As always, your code must run on CSIT machines. 6. You must submit a single ZIP file‚Äîuse zip/WinZIP to zip your files before submitting---do NOT submit rar or zipx files!! 7. If you use packages, it is your responsibility that these unpack properly into the correct folders and that your program compiles correctly. ",,5

To achieve this all products in the mall should be equipped with RFID tags and smart check-out counter. First of all customer must login / signup with the system. When one puts any product on RFID reader its code will be detected automatically, the item name and cost will be displayed on the LCD, thereby the cost gets added to the total bill. You need to continue this process until you complete with scanning of all the products. After completion, you may generate the bill which would be mailed to your registered account and the amount will be debited from your registered credit card.

944,https://github.com/Nikkitaseth/ProjectAlpha.git,"PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API‚Äôs URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective financial statements of each company and assigned them to a variable using utils.py.  Discounted Cash Flow Model First of all, I needed to import the functions I defined in utils.py before defining the DCF model function, which would run for every company in our list. Next, I ensured to have 5 consecutive years of past data to compute the average. Thus, the first few lines of code checked whether the last year on record was 2019 from which point I would go back 5 years; if the last year was 2018, this would be taken as the first data entry from which I would go back 5 years. The second part mentioned above is important because companies file their 10-K, i.e. their annual report, at different times throughout the year so there may be companies that already filed their reports while others had not. After this step, five-year averages of every item‚Äôs percentage of revenue Ire calculated as Ill as the average revenue growth over the same period. These items included EBIT, depreciation & amortization, capital expenditures, and the change in net working capital. Once that was done, there Ire only three variables missing before calculating free cash flows for the next few years: a discount or hurdle rate; industry-specific perpetual growth rates; and a tax rate. After these three variables Ire set up, the next step was to calculate the free cash flows to the firm (fcff) for the next 5 years and determine the terminal value at the end of the period using the growth rate for the corresponding industry. For the former, I use a loop to calculate the fcff for all the year, discount it, and add it to one variable called fcffpv. Once the terminal value was calculated, these two additional numbers captured the enterprise value of the firm. Since I Ire interested in the equity value, I subtracted debt and add cash, which left us with the equity value. In one final step, I divided this value by the number of shares to end up with an intrinsic value per share. After calculating the intrinsic value per share, I compared it to the current share price with two additions. First, I added a buffer to minimize our downside risk for inaccuracy in calculations, which is called the margin of safety. Here, the intrinsic value should at least be 115% of the current share price. I also set an upper limit at 130% to ensure I would not include companies with extraordinarily high valuations, compared to their current price. If the share price calculated fell within this window, I added its ticker to a dataframe, which was the last step in the function. As such, the DCF function would run for every company and provide a dataframe with the tickers of all those companies that Ire undervalued at the time and fell within the 115% - 130% range.  Portfolio Optimization The dataframe with the tickers of all the undervalued companies that was previously created has now become the portfolio, which I converted into a list and used as the source for further optimization that is about to come. Some general inputs for the rest of the code Ire the start and end date of the data I requested for optimization, as Ill as the risk-free rate and the number of simulations I wanted to run our optimizations for. Now that the general framework has been created, it is time to choose some conditioning variables to measure the performance of investment in one sector or across a combination of some/all sectors, respectively.  Project Alpha uses the following conditioning variables to optimize its portfolios: ‚Ä¢ Sharpe Ratio: It measures the performance of an investment compared to the risk-free asset, i.e. the 10-year Treasury Bond, after adjusting for its risk factor or standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio would be given a higher Iight for investors who have a higher risk tolerance.  In terms of code, I used the bt package to retrieve the data betIen the predetermined start and end date for the companies in our ticker list. This data was then used to find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. For that, random Iights Ire assigned to each company and the ratio was computed. After running the number of simulations previously determined, the Iights with the highest Sharpe ratio will be located using loc() and labeled ‚Äòsharpe_portfolio‚Äô which is a dataframe containing the excess return, the volatility, Sharpe ratio, as Ill as the Iights for every company. I also located the portfolio with the loIst volatility, put it in a dataframe called ‚Äòmin_volatility_port‚Äô which has the same attributes. The rest of the code of this segment simply created a picture with all the portfolios generated, displaying the efficient frontier and highlighting the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio and loIst volatility. ‚Ä¢ Value at Risk (VaR): VaR was chosen as a diagnostic tool to assess the model. In our case, it basically indicated the percentage of time in which a loss greater than 1% would occur over a period of 5 years. Its limitation is that although it measures how bad the best of the bad is, it does not measure how bad it can get, meaning the worst of the worst. In regards to the code, I first requested the adjusted closing for the companies in our ticker list in the determined time horizon. I then retrieved the Iights from our Sharpe portfolio, set the number of days I wanted to simulate as Ill as the cutoff, before calculating the returns of every company in every period; here: daily. Thereafter, I created a new variable called ‚Äòsigma‚Äô, which was be a copy of our return variable, in order to ensure the right format and type for our Monte Carlo loop. The simulation is pretty straight forward, as it measures how many runs the returns fall within 1% or outside of it. I then Iighed the resulting returns by the Iight of the company in the portfolio and whenever the portfolio return was outside the set boundary, it would count as a ‚Äòbad simulation‚Äô. Once that is done, the number of bad simulations was divided by the total number of simulations to end up with a percentage of how many simulations were bad, which equals our VaR ‚Ä¢ Treynor Ratio: For the investors that already have a perfectly diversified portfolio and would like to add more assets to it, there would be a higher Iight on the Treynor ratio. It basically uses beta as a risk factor because it carries the risk relative to the market, instead of standard deviation as in Sharpe, meaning only systematic or non-diversifiable risk.  For the code, I first calculated the portfolio‚Äôs beta. For that, I defined a function ‚Äòbeta‚Äô that reads the beta of every company and returns it. The next step is to run a loop that would enter the beta of every company in our ticker list into a new dataframe. After setting the index equal to the tickers and transposing the Sharpe portfolio Iights, I can concat the two thus resulting in two columns: one is the beta of every company and the second is the corresponding Iight in the portfolio. I then created a third column as the product of columns one and two. The sum of all entries in that column is the portfolio beta, which was then used as the denominator for the ratio. The nominator was already calculated as ‚ÄòExcess Return‚Äô in the Sharpe portfolio. ‚Ä¢ Sortino Ratio: The Sortino ratio measures only the downside risk (downside deviation or semi-deviation) by measuring returns against a minimum acceptable return, ùúè. It is surprising to know that most of the industry ignores the total number of periods taken and just calculates the downside deviation by choosing the periods with downside risk, which results in misleading results. Project Alpha uses all the periods to calculate the same, so as to have an advantage over those robo-advisors/financial advisors that do not follow this process. The alpha in the future would be generated by going long on companies with high correct Sortino and low incorrect Sortino as they are undervalued, and shorting those with low correct Sortino and high incorrect Sortino as these are overvalued. The Sortino ratio would be given more Iight for investors who are more risk averse.  This part of the code started with retrieving the data for our benchmark, the S&P 500, for the period and the calculating the average daily and annual return. After that, I calculate the portfolio returns, ‚Äòreturns[‚ÄúReturns‚Äù]‚Äô, by adding the products of every company‚Äôs Iight times its return, which gave us the portfolio return for every period. From here, I calculated the downside risk by comparing the portfolio return in every period to the daily average return of our benchmark in a for loop. Before I did that, I defined a new variable called ‚Äòsemi‚Äô, which is a data series and will be filled with whatever comes out of the loop every single time. If the portfolio return minus the average daily return of the benchmark was greater than 0 ‚Äì meaning the portfolio earned more than the average of the S&P500 ‚Äì the value for the period was set to 0 and added to the semi data series. If it is 0, which is extremely unlikely, but whatever, it would also be 0. If it is less than 0, hoIver, which indicates underperformance, I would square the portfolio return, which already gives us the semi variance I need for our next step. From here, I can simply take the square root of the average of the ‚Äòsemi‚Äô data series to get the daily downside risk and multiplying it by the square root of 252, which gives us the annual number. After that, I have all the numbers to calculate the Sortino ratio. ‚Ä¢ Information Ratio: The information ratio measures the portfolio returns compared to the returns of a benchmark index, i.e. S&P500, after adjusting for its additional risk. It only looks at the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark and the volatility or risk associated with it. I already have all the inputs I need to calculate his ratio. Thus, I simply created a new dataframe with the portfolio returns of every period and the benchmark returns of every period. To find the excess return, i.e. the nominator, I simply subtracted the latter from the former and assigned it to a new variable, which I called ‚Äòexcess_return‚Äô. The nominator would be the average return of the portfolio minus the average return of the benchmark, and the denominator would be the standard deviation of the ‚Äòexcess_return‚Äô series. Finally, I printed short sentences with the results for every conditioning variable just described as an output in the console.",,2

946,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script.git,"Contact : flokif418@gmail.com  About script  Marketplace v2.0 is also written in PHP with Laravel framework. Its using latest standards for encryption (like Sodium library) and security. Its made without use of JavaScript, so its optimized for TOR, but can also be ran normally like any other web app (as you can see on demo).  \xa0  Requirements  VPS with at least 2GB of RAM  Daemon for each coin that is enabled on marketplace  Server requirements:\xa0(what software is needed on VPS)  PHP 7 (recommended and tested on 7.2)  SQL Database (MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)  Elasticsearch (Search interface that will keep track of search records and provide great search performance)  Redis (Optional, but will greatly increase app performance )   \xa0Features  Categories Category system is very dynamic. Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders\xa0completed\xa0most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user‚Äôs PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user‚Äôs choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is ‚ÄúAdd to wishlist‚Äù button that can be used, and they are stored in user‚Äôs personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:  \xa0 \xa0‚Äòmultipliers‚Äô => [ ‚Äòproduct_delivered‚Äô => 10, ‚Äòproduct_dispute_lost‚Äô =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_star‚Äô => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_usd‚Äô => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece ‚Ä¶). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product‚Äôs quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin‚Äôs decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography\xa0(like\xa0XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF)\xa0to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user‚Äôs password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B‚Äôs public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don‚Äôt need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index ‚Äì Basic information  Categories ‚Äì Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages ‚Äì Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users ‚Äì View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products ‚Äì View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log ‚Äì Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage ‚Äì Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes ‚Äì View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets ‚Äì View and resolve support tickets  Purchases ‚Äì List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases ‚Äì List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin ‚Äì Included in standard version  Monero ‚Äì Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included.

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat‚Äù Considerations: Admin portal authentication/authorisation can be mocked and not required to be fully implemented at this stage or focused at; Initial focus should be on backend and Web API implementation rather than front-end and UI/UX; No user login required to use GLvNext API; Please show usage of HttpClient in the solution; The system should be able to handle high load especially on API side but also handle possible large datasets coming from external sources, consider that this might be a part of large system and integrating with multiple data providers;  Choice of frontend stack is not important (we usually do standard ASP.net Core MVC, jquery or vue.js rather than SPA type of web apps)  Backend stack preferably .NET Core, any version 2.1 to 3.1;  Use Azure stack if familiar; Data persistence / ORM, the choice is yours, preference would be MS SQL and EF Core; Remote API to Consume Remote Offers API details: https://2d976b39.azurewebsites.net/v1/offers https://2d976b39.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html Required headers Gl-ApiKey: 8B5A92FC-CA0F-4920-9358-50D2EE74A716 Gl-AppKey: FB Feel free to ask questions about this API during the test. To-Do  Provide the following Approximate estimate in hours/days; High level breakdown of tasks to do; Next, you are required to set up the solution and start implementation. You are not expected to complete this within given 2 hours, so this is not a speed/stress test, simply work in your normal pace, the way you would usually do on a project. Please, submit your work either by zipping the solution up and sharing (dropbox etc.) or via GitHub, GitLab, Azure devops etc. Any clarification and questions are most welcome either via skype or email. Skype: pavel.orlov000 Email: pavel@globalloyalty.com  Bonus Task A bit of refactoring, please spend 15 min to review and submit PR with a few initial changes you recommend here if any. If you think it needs to be refactored further, put your ideas in the description of the PR. https://github.com/jack0fshad0ws/Interview-Quiz/blob/master/GL.FileParser/Class1.cs",,1
