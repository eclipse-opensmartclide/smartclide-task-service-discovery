Extending functionality without compromising the security.  Personal banking services that gives you complete control over all your banking demands online.  Simple and easy user interface to work with.  Online Banking features: Registration for online banking by Admin.  Adding Beneficiary account by customer.  Transferring amount to the beneficiary added by customer.  Staff must approve for beneficiary activation before it can be used for transferring funds.  Customer gets to know his last login date and time each time he logs in.  Customer can check last 10 transactions made with their account.  Customer can check their account statement within a date range.  Customer can request for ATM and Cheque Book.  Staff will approve requests for ATM card and cheque book.  Admin can add/edit/delete customer as well as staff.  All three of them(customer, staff & admin) can change their password.  Staff and Admin Login pages are hidden from customer for security purpose.  Security: Each and every input is passed through mysql_real_escape_string() to remove special characters from the string so that user can‚Äôt submit arbitrary input. It protects from attacks like Sql Injection and Cross Site Scripting(XSS).  Passwords are encrypted with SHA- 1 hashing algorithm and then stored in database.  Passwords are stored as encrypted hashes with an additional random salt for added security.  Note: If we talk about security,above mentioned points would provide no security at all but it will work for beginners. Being into web app pentesting,I very well know this project will not be considered secure. It needs atleast a more effective filtering mechanism, better hashing algorithm, a better salting procedure for storing passwords and some other things too.  Database: The database contains customer, staff & admin tables.  Each customer has its own virtual passbook linked with its account number.  Staff, customer and, admin have their details and password in their respective tables with all the details.  A separate table for beneficiary is included in the database.  A table for cheque book and ATM requests is included.  This project is divided into three hierarchical parts:  The index page for the customer login.  A hidden staff login page.  A hidden admin login page.  Usage: 1.Install XAMPP or something similar.  2.Copy all the files to c:/xampp/htdocs/banking/  3.Create a db named as 'bnak_db' and import the bank_db.sql from phpMyAdmin.  4.change the password in _inc/dbconn.php file accordingly.  5.visit localhost/banking (customer index page)  6.visit localhost/banking/adminlogin.php (admin login)  7.visit the localhost/banking/staff_login.php (staff login)""}",,28

However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

350,https://github.com/hadanischal/PublisherFacts.git,"iOS Proficiency Exercise (Banking) Overview The purpose of this exercise is to assess candidate developer‚Äôs iOS coding knowledge and style. The exercise involves build a ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù app which consumes a REST service and displays photos with headings and descriptions. The exercise will be evaluated on coding style, understanding of programming concepts, choice of techniques, and also by the developer‚Äôs process, as indicated by the trail of git commits.        Specification       Create a universal iOS app which: 1. Ingests a json feed from   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json   2. You can use a third party json parser to parse this if desired.   3. The feed contains a title and a list of rows   4. Use Collection View to display the content. Making sure the CollectionViewCell size is dynamic and which should vary based on the image size.          5. Restrict the image to go to outside of the device width if image is having a larger width then your device. 6. Loads the images lazily   7. Don‚Äôt download them all at once, but only as needed 8. Refresh function 9. Each image having title at the bottom of the image. 10. For iphone & iPad (portrait)- When click on collection view image, navigate to detail page having title on navigation bar with image as banner and description at the bottom of the banner image. 11. For iphone & iPad (landscape)- When click on collection view image, navigate to detail page having title on navigation bar with image on the left hand side of the screen and description at the right hand side of the screen (ratio size of the screen between image and description is 30:70).      Note - Should not block UI when loading the data from the json feed.           Guidelines        1. Use Git to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is required.   2. Scrolling the collection view should be smooth, even as images are downloading and getting added to the cells.   3. App should support both iPhone and iPad (in both orientations).   4. If threading is considered - Do no spawn threads manually by using performSelectorOnBackgroundThread, use GCD queues instead. 5. Use auto layout while designing the screen. 6. Comment your code where necessary.   7. Try to polish your code and the apps functionality as much as possible.   8. Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments   9. Do not use any singletons in your submission        Additional Requirements 1. Supports all iOS versions from the latest back to iOS8       ","ios-swift,mvvm-architecture,solid-principles,unittesting",5

Normalization was done with standard scaler before performing cross validation with repeated K-fold and evaluating based on accuracy and confusion matrix results. Later, important features impacting prediction was determined with random forest classifier. Prediction model was built with decision tree classifier, resulting in an accuracy of 63%. ",,3

563,https://github.com/bobeezy/Video-Store-ATM-Point-Of-Sale-System.git,"{""‚ÄúMy name is Gregory Guy. I have just purchased a video store, and I need an up to date, GUI driven system to keep track of all the stock in my store. I am not happy with the existing system where everything is done by hand.  ‚ÄúCurrently, the store operates on a cash basis, although a contract system might be in the pipeline. You will be contacted to do this at a later stage, if necessary. I have a shop next door that sells sweets, drinks, chocolates etc, which runs from a separate cash register. This should not be included in the system you develop.  ‚ÄúMy store not only stocks videos, but also video machines, as well as DVD‚Äôs.  At a later stage, I would like to also stock Sony PlayStation games, controls, and possibly other stock items. I want to be able to add these into the stock list with the minimum of hassle, and without calling in the help of a programmer / system designer.  ‚ÄúI want to store all transactional information in a database, so that my accounting system can interface with the data.  ‚ÄúI charge as follows: New Release: (Video or DVD)\t\tR16 Older Stock: (Video or DVD)\t\tR12 ‚Ä¢\tVideo Machine\t\t\t\t\tR30 ‚Ä¢\tVideo Machine & any two videos:\tR50  ‚ÄúWhen I start stocking PlayStation games and/or consoles (or any other stock items), I would probably want to have a two-tier pricing system for them as well (where I can charge more for newer stock).  ‚ÄúIt would also be nice to be able to change my prices if and when I need to. I therefore would like the ability to change the price of a ‚ÄòNew Release‚Äô, and that should affect all the videos/DVD‚Äôs that fall into that category. The same should apply to the other prices mentioned above.  ‚ÄúI have a couple of shop assistants that helps me out, and I would like some security built in so that the assistants cannot get access to my financial and other important data.   Functionality:  ‚ÄúI obviously need the system to take care of the most important part of the business:- the quick and accurate ‚Äòbooking out‚Äô of all stock items. The customer, upon bringing me his/her selection, must be charged accordingly, and the items must be marked as ‚Äòout‚Äô.  ‚ÄúThe system should also allow me to quickly and easily record the returned stock items, as and when they do come in.   ‚ÄúSometimes I also want to credit the customer for something, as the tape/DVD/game might have been damaged before they rented it. The item should then be marked as returned, but as money is then given back to the customer, some sort of record should be kept about this credit transaction so that I can trace which assistant allowed the credit. This will help me minimize fraudulent behaviour where assistants can basically book out resources ‚Äòfor free‚Äô.  ‚ÄúI also want the system to have an advance booking facility, where an existing customer can call in and book a certain video/DVD/other item for a certain day. The system should not allow an item to be booked out twice for a certain date, and if something has been booked out and another customer tries to rent it, at least a warning should be displayed, informing the teller that this is the case. In special cases, such a booking can then be ignored, but most times the teller will inform the customer that s/he cannot have that item for the day. A facility should also be included where the booking can be cancelled at any time, if necessary. (For example, if a customer cancels the booking telephonically, whether it is on the day, or some time in advance).  ‚ÄúAlthough it could be considered part of the accounting package, I would like this system to be able to do a daily summary, where I am presented with total sales (monetary value), total number of rentals (total videos; total DVD‚Äôs, total machines,) etc. This can be shown to me either on the screen, or in a printed form. I would like you to decide on the format and content of this screen/report.  ‚ÄúAnother function that I would like you to incorporate, is that the system should be able to do some analysis for me. Examples of this include: ‚Ä¢\tTop Ten rentals ‚Ä¢\tTop Ten customers ‚Ä¢\tStock items that have not been rented out in 6 months or more.  I would like the above three to be done, but if you can think of other examples, feel free to add them in if you have time.    ‚ÄúThe system should allow me to add/edit all customer details, and if necessary (not often) delete a customer. Customer details to be stored include, but are not limited to: Name Surname Title I.D. Number Address and Postal Code Telephone Number (Work) Telephone Number (Home) Telephone Number (Mobile)  ‚ÄúThe system should also allow me to update the information regarding my stock items, for example: ‚Ä¢\tMark a tape as damaged. ‚Ä¢\tChange a video from a ‚ÄòNew Release‚Äô to ‚ÄòOlder Stock‚Äô. ‚Ä¢\tChange the category it belongs to.  ‚ÄúI have several working, but old machines lying around at my house, and they are already network-capable. I would like you to build some functionality where these machines can be linked to the system you are designing so that they can be used as ‚Äòlook-up‚Äô machines. Basically, if a shop assistant is not available, but a customer knows the title of the movie they are looking for, they should be able to go to one of these terminals that I will set up throughout my shop, and enter or select the movie name, and perhaps what they are looking for (video/dvd/game etc). If my shop carries the chosen item, then the system should give them enough information (shelf number/category etc.) to be able to locate the item in the shop. It should also show if an item is unavailable, and when it is due back. If they select an invalid item, they should be informed of this.  ‚ÄúThe above program should run independently of the main system, and should not access the database directly.  The video store will have employees, customers, stock and suppliers. Employees, customers and suppliers related to the video store can be created, deleted or updated.  Creating / updating / deleting a customer profile (video store) will be very similar to that of creating / updating / deleting a customer‚Äôs account in the banking industry.   The stock status also needs to be up to date (available, rented, late or damaged).  An ATM will be inside the video store. The ATM is available to both the public and the employees. The ATM can be used for: Bank account balance inquiry, money withdrawal, funds transfer and transaction history (last 5 transactions with dates, time, type of transaction and outcome). The ATM should also cancel a transaction request and swallow a debit card when the user has entered a wrong pin number three times in succession. The ATM can only be used by clients who have existing bank accounts and existing (valid) debit cards. Make provision for situations such as expired debit cards, frozen accounts, insufficient funds, daily withdrawal limit exceeded, etc.  The video store works on a cash-only-basis. Customers can withdraw money at the ATM if they don't have cash on them. The ATM is also available to public who only wants to use the ATM (without having to do business with the video store).  Payment for stock rented: A Point Of Sale screen (electronic cash register screen) needs to be displayed. The product and the quantity thereof needs to be entered. You can make use of drop boxes if you want to. The system will calculate the total amount due (and the due date back for the products). Enter the cash amount offered by the customer. Calculate the change amount. Update the video store transaction register.  Stock returned: Update the electronic system. Make provision for the condition in which the stock items were returned (in a working state or damaged, on time or late - individually).  Capture a history record of products rented. Know the value of the stock outside the store. Capture a history record of products currently late. Capture a history record of products damaged. Capture a history record of products currently in store. Calculate the value of stock in-store.  Capture a history record of each registered client's rental record.  Capture a history record of a client's ATM transactions.  ""}",,3
564,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons.git,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain‚Äìmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors\' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There‚Äôs nothing artificial about AI...It‚Äôs inspired by people, it‚Äôs created by people, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.‚Äù[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so","aryia-behroziuan,artificial-intelligence,wikipedia,an-ann,neural-network,android,bootstrap,csharp,deep-learning,expressjs,firebase",3

Settling these is imperative as mobile banking technology usage continues to rise.  As indicated by a report, ‚Äúthe normal cost of an information break for each bargained record was approx $148, and it took associations 196 days, on average, to identify a breach.  Generally speaking, the aggregate costs, per-capita cost a normal size of a data breach have all expanded a seemingly endless amount of time.‚Äù With developing cybersecurity alarms, these internet banking problems and Losses appear to conceivably increase and cause a serious disturbance in the market scenario.  Moreover, the development of Fintechs has resulted in the utilization of cell phones for bank application, cryptocurrency and investing services. Their definitive target is to make secure banking solutions effortlessly accessible and approachable for general buyers. The idea of Fintechs rotates around utilizing innovation for improved customer encounter and consistent utilization of financial services. Consequently, in any conceivable situation, the application can‚Äôt break!     Think differently to crash-proof your online banking services: None of us can envision the normal internet banking problems that may happen if our banking applications crash, and more awful of all if there is a break. As per a report by Deloitte, ‚ÄòCyber risk is the top worry for mobile banking solution providers. Remaining in front of changing business needs and tending to dangers from progressively more complex sophisticated actors are top difficulties for administrators.  This level of development is additionally reflected in the way cyber risk is right now overseen at numerous banks. Specifically, financing for cybersecurity keeps on expanding and there is more noteworthy collaboration among banks, counterparties, and controllers, including the sharing of data and best practices. However the cyber risk is just getting more complicated, and in ways that are not completely predictable and understood by many.‚Äô  Take a look at these simple hacks that innovators enterprises and modern visualizers can consider while creating banking app Turn into a Hacker The most ideal approach to stop a hack or a breach is to engineer that breach. This will encourage testers and engineers to monitor the dangers and holes as they happen. Besides, the ‚Äòattack‚Äô would be from outside as an outer gatecrasher with noxious aims. The ‚Äòattack‚Äô can be built in different structures, by means of an open Wi-Fi or a mobile system to check the effect on the security factors and even the execution.  Monitor against networks Great network and poor network, an application can carry on diversely under both network conditions. Consequently, it is basic to test your application under both the networks. Particularly, under poor network conditions, the application can indicate flimsiness, poor execution, prompting a crash. Thus, to guarantee that the product‚Äôs usefulness stays stable under all network situations, it is prescribed to test the application under slow network conditions  Check for the memory of the application We regularly get notification from clients that the application runs moderately with time and after that at last crashes. The noticeable explanation for this is the application‚Äôs memory. In this way, it‚Äôs vital to take a look at memory administration factors while building your application. Recognize zones that expend a great deal of memory, examine information structures, and continue organizing the memory needs of an application once it hits the buyer‚Äôs cell phone.  Guarantee compatibility with the gadget One of the best help of guaranteeing compatibility is to upgrade the user experience. When you check for compatibility, you approve the application‚Äôs UI, preparing power, loading limit, and different foundation strings on a specific gadget. In any case, there is less plausibility that you may have the capacity to cover each gadget, OS, and setup while testing your mobile banking apps. In any case, while arranging your testing procedure, it‚Äôs imperative to organize.
