However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

0,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons.git,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain‚Äìmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors\' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There‚Äôs nothing artificial about AI...It‚Äôs inspired by people, it‚Äôs created by people, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.‚Äù[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so","aryia-behroziuan,artificial-intelligence,wikipedia,an-ann,neural-network,android,bootstrap,csharp,deep-learning,expressjs,firebase",3

Settling these is imperative as mobile banking technology usage continues to rise.  As indicated by a report, ‚Äúthe normal cost of an information break for each bargained record was approx $148, and it took associations 196 days, on average, to identify a breach.  Generally speaking, the aggregate costs, per-capita cost a normal size of a data breach have all expanded a seemingly endless amount of time.‚Äù With developing cybersecurity alarms, these internet banking problems and Losses appear to conceivably increase and cause a serious disturbance in the market scenario.  Moreover, the development of Fintechs has resulted in the utilization of cell phones for bank application, cryptocurrency and investing services. Their definitive target is to make secure banking solutions effortlessly accessible and approachable for general buyers. The idea of Fintechs rotates around utilizing innovation for improved customer encounter and consistent utilization of financial services. Consequently, in any conceivable situation, the application can‚Äôt break!     Think differently to crash-proof your online banking services: None of us can envision the normal internet banking problems that may happen if our banking applications crash, and more awful of all if there is a break. As per a report by Deloitte, ‚ÄòCyber risk is the top worry for mobile banking solution providers. Remaining in front of changing business needs and tending to dangers from progressively more complex sophisticated actors are top difficulties for administrators.  This level of development is additionally reflected in the way cyber risk is right now overseen at numerous banks. Specifically, financing for cybersecurity keeps on expanding and there is more noteworthy collaboration among banks, counterparties, and controllers, including the sharing of data and best practices. However the cyber risk is just getting more complicated, and in ways that are not completely predictable and understood by many.‚Äô  Take a look at these simple hacks that innovators enterprises and modern visualizers can consider while creating banking app Turn into a Hacker The most ideal approach to stop a hack or a breach is to engineer that breach. This will encourage testers and engineers to monitor the dangers and holes as they happen. Besides, the ‚Äòattack‚Äô would be from outside as an outer gatecrasher with noxious aims. The ‚Äòattack‚Äô can be built in different structures, by means of an open Wi-Fi or a mobile system to check the effect on the security factors and even the execution.  Monitor against networks Great network and poor network, an application can carry on diversely under both network conditions. Consequently, it is basic to test your application under both the networks. Particularly, under poor network conditions, the application can indicate flimsiness, poor execution, prompting a crash. Thus, to guarantee that the product‚Äôs usefulness stays stable under all network situations, it is prescribed to test the application under slow network conditions  Check for the memory of the application We regularly get notification from clients that the application runs moderately with time and after that at last crashes. The noticeable explanation for this is the application‚Äôs memory. In this way, it‚Äôs vital to take a look at memory administration factors while building your application. Recognize zones that expend a great deal of memory, examine information structures, and continue organizing the memory needs of an application once it hits the buyer‚Äôs cell phone.  Guarantee compatibility with the gadget One of the best help of guaranteeing compatibility is to upgrade the user experience. When you check for compatibility, you approve the application‚Äôs UI, preparing power, loading limit, and different foundation strings on a specific gadget. In any case, there is less plausibility that you may have the capacity to cover each gadget, OS, and setup while testing your mobile banking apps. In any case, while arranging your testing procedure, it‚Äôs imperative to organize.

As mobile transactions continue to increase, online fraud detection continues to become a bigger issue. Although fraud via smartphones is increasing at a faster pace than general PC/laptop based fraud, smartphones have the potential to become as secure a channel as the web through the use of advanced encryption and authentication technologies. By paying close attention to red flags and suspicious activities, you can avoid merchant services fraud. According to the 2018 Global fraud report, it is evident that out of the digital market place consumers 91% of customers use smartphone out of which 88% use for personal banking and it has been noted that 72% cite fraud as a growing concern over the past twelve months and 63% report higher level of fraudulent losses over that same period. One such activity is cited in the rise of Synthetic identities. Synthetic identities come from accounts not held by actual individuals, but by fabricated identities created to perpetuate fraud. These identities are created by combining the credentials and information of a mixed set of individuals to create a completely new ID. Criminals use this kind of technique to commit frauds in the area of healthcare, utility services and taxes. The research in the area of combatting such kind of frauds, motivates us to find a robust system to detect fraudulent transactions. Smartphones have been an easy target for fraudsters as it lacks the security level that other mobile devices have. Fraudsters know that it is generally easier to take over an account by phishing, spear phishing (targeting an individual) or Smishing (phishing via a mobile device), than to open a new account using a real or ‚Äòsynthetic‚Äô identity, which is why the risk of account takeover is one of the most alarming trends in fraud.

A3: {accountId:3, accountNumber:100003, balance:$354,005.26} ‚Äì belongs to customer, C2; This account is of the AccountType, Checking. For this question, you are required to do the following: 1. Draw a simple UML Static (class) model for the software solution. 2. Using the set of tools, technologies and frameworks which you have learnt about in this CS425 course, including Spring Boot Spring Web MVC, Spring Data JPA, etc., (or some other Enterprise Web application development platform/tool(s) that you prefer), implement a working web application for MidWesTen Bank. You may use any database of your choice.  You are expected to implement only the following features and use-cases: 1. Display a homepage which presents a set of menu options. 2. Display list of Customers (Allows the bank manager to view a list of all the Customers registered in the system). The bank requires this list to be displayed sorted in ascending order of the Customers‚Äô last names (see sample screen below). 3. Register a new Customer (Allows the bank manager to add a new Customer into the system). 4. Display list of Accounts (Allows the bank manager to view a list of all the Accounts held in the system). The bank requires this list to be displayed sorted in ascending order of the Account Number (see sample screen below). 5. Open a new Account (Allows the bank manager to add/open a new Account for an existing customer in the system). 6. Display the bank‚Äôs net liquidity position (This means the system presents to the bank manager, a computed value that represents the bank‚Äôs net liquidity. This value is computed by taking the sum of the Savings and Checking accounts balances minus the sum of the Loan accounts balances. It represents the total amount of cash expected in the bank‚Äôs vault). Your solution should display this data at the bottom of the ‚ÄúList of Accounts‚Äù table (see sample screen below). 7. Using the JUnit framework, write a Unit Test case for your function/method that computes the bank‚Äôs net liquidity. Be sure to execute your Test-case and take a screenshot of your result, as displayed by your IDE. Shown below are sample User Interfaces for the use-cases/tasks. Note: Your own UI design does NOT necessarily have to look exactly like these samples. But your UIs should contain all the necessary data and data fields, as shown.",,1

Marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on the customer needs and their overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. There are certain variables that we need to take into consideration when making a marketing campaign.  ## The 4 Ps:  1) Segment of the Population: To which segment of the population is the marketing campaign going to address and why? This aspect of the marketing campaign is extremely important since it will tell to which part of the population should most likely receive the message of the marketing campaign.  2) Distribution channel to reach the customer's place: Implementing the most effective strategy in order to get the most out of this marketing campaign. What segment of the population should we address? Which instrument should we use to get our message out? (Ex: Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media Etc.)  3) Price: What is the best price to offer to potential clients? (In the case of the bank's marketing campaign this is not necessary since the main interest for the bank is for potential clients to open depost accounts in order to make the operative activities of the bank to keep on running.)  4) Promotional Strategy: This is the way the strategy is going to be implemented and how are potential clients going to be address. This should be the last part of the marketing campaign analysis since there has to be an indepth analysis of previous campaigns (If possible) in order to learn from previous mistakes and to determine how to make the marketing campaign much more effective.  ## What is a Term Deposit?  A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institurion offers with a fixed rate (often better than just opening deposit account) in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time. For more information with regards to Term Deposits please click on this link from Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp  ## Outline:  1. Import data from dataset and perform initial high-level analysis: look at the number of rows, look at the missing values, look at dataset columns and their values respective to the campaign outcome. 2. Clean the data: remove irrelevant columns, deal with missing and incorrect values, turn categorical columns into dummy variables. 3. Use machine learning techniques to predict the marketing campaign outcome and to find out factors, which affect the success of the campaign.   ## Dataset Link    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing  ## Dataset Information    The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.  There are four datasets: 1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014] 2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. 3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).  The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).    ## Attribute Information    Input variables: #### bank client data: 1-age (numeric)   2-job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')   3-marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed) 4-education(categorical:'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown') 5-default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   6-housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   7-loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   #### related with the last contact of the current campaign: 8-contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')   9-month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')   10-day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')   11-duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.   #### other attributes: 12-campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)   13-pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)   14-previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)   15-poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')   #### social and economic context attributes 16-emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)   17-cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)   18-cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)   19-euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)   20-nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)    Output variable (desired target):   21-y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')     ## License  This dataset is public available for research.   Citations -   1.Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.

A Government by the Australian People for the Australian People.  It gets rid of the old antiquated divisive antagonistic Federal and State Westminster system of Government and Opposition. It gets rid of the Senate. It gets rid of Parliamentarians and Political Parties.  And it gets rid of Australian State Governments.  All Lawfully through the 1901 Constitution of Australia via Referendum of the Australian People. In fact this whole New System is in essence based on a continual transparent online Referendum of the Australian People.  Think of the enormous savings from antique inherited costs, corruption, corporatocracy, fascism, cronism and downright idiocy, in-efficiency and in-effectiveness of the current (Non)Government of Australia.  This New Australian People‚Äôs Government system is what is termed an ‚ÄòOpen Ended‚Äô Grassroots Meritocracy. This means:  It is run by the Australian People for the Australian People. The Voice of the Australian People drives the debates, decisions and actions of the Government.  This is all enabled by modern online transparent web-based technologies.  It can include many and all future opportunities of better Government including changes in all systems and policies including, for example, monetary, banking, health, education, welfare, farming, environment, water, environment and minerals all managed and controlled by the Australian People ourselves and not by this current disgraceful dishonest mob of self seeking corporate ego maniacs.  It allows unlimited access for the common Australian People via instant online video conferencing to put forward their ideas, issues and brainstorming to create a better Australia for All.  These ideas are then captured, structured and then debated and voted by transparent open groups of Australians, who will naturally migrate to debate and vote on issues that concern them and about which they have knowledge and wisdom. This is called a Meritocracy.  Once the ideas have been debated and voted on, they are put to the Australian People generally, and if there is acceptance, the ideas are put into Practice via the Executive Structures which currently includes the Public Service Sector.  The Soul of this New Australian Government is the Human Values of Truth, Unconditional Love, Virtue (Help Ever, Hurt Never), Peace and Non-Violence.  The Brain, Nervous System and Heart of our New Government are the Voices of our Australian People heard and brought together by modern online video conferencing and associated web-based applications.  The Various synergistic Specialised Organs of our New Government can be considered the transparent online Meritocracy of Separation of Issue definition, recording, debate and voting thus enabled.",,0

The tie up is to focus on online marketing and distribution of loans for agri commodities against warehouse receipts and collateral management.  Commodity Online is rolling out an agri commodity financing platform through its flagship portal www.commodityonline.com where farmers and traders can track commodity markets and warehouses online and get financing for their commodities quickly.  Commodity Online plans to aggressively get into the online space to provide financing for agri commodities with collateral management across India.  Agri financing against warehouse receipts is an underdeveloped, but a sector with vast potential in a country like India where only less than 40% of traders have access to institutional credit. Barely 10-15% small and marginal farmers get access to finance in India.  Agri loans against warehouse receipts were around Rs 5000 crores ten years back. Currently, banking institutions have lent around Rs 40000 crore against warehouse receipts.  According to George Iype, Managing Director of Commodity Online, the portal has rolled out an exclusive online platform wherein farmers and traders can track the spot market prices of all commodities live, check where warehouses are available and track research insights from each commodity market across India.  ‚ÄúCommodity financing has the potential to grow to a Rs 2 lakh crore business by 2025 in India. Commodity Online is focused on providing various easy financing solutions online through its partnership with Federal Bank,‚Äù Iype said. He further added that as Internet penetration increases, online platforms like Commodity Online will reach further into rural areas from where more business will get generated.  ‚ÄúThose wanting to get agri loans with collateral management facilities can register in commodityonline.com with their KYC details and get approval for the financing for a range of commodities very quickly,‚Äù Iype added.  In 2007 a separate Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) was established which introduced a negotiable warehouse receipt system. This opened up not only scientific warehousing techniques in India but also enabled commodity owners to take advantage of their produce as collaterals for finance. From a meagre 5000 crore financing in early 2000, the business is expected to grow at least 20 times in the coming 3 years. ",,0
0,https://github.com/gkrks/sop.git,"STATEMENT OF PURPOSE 34 pale yellow postcards, worn out color pens and an address book : unfurled on the balcony, with me and my grandfather amidst the little chaos. It was one of Thatha‚Äôs(native reference to grandfather)  grand traditions to send out personally inscribed messages to the entire family for every New year‚Äôs and Diwali(a Hindu festival with lights).As a young girl I wondered if there was a way to send out good thoughts and wishes without him having to worry if his cards would reach on time and me about my wiped out stationery. This was the time when the Computers and the Internet was still in its nascent stage in India. We bought our first computer when I was twelve years of old. The curiosity for computer and its science led to an obvious choice of major in high school and undergrad. Although the real defining moment was in the second year of college when I was asked to join a team of seniors for a coding competition. We beat twenty-three teams from all over the state for a spot in the finals. I still remember the sense of euphoria I felt when we I executed my task and coding became my drug of choice. There was no turning back from that point. I participated in various programming contests after that. Completed various online courses on Python, Java, Algorithms, Website development, Video game development etc.. I especially enjoyed creating pet projects in Python for my friends and family. In my free time I contribute to open source projects on Github mostly in Java. Presented a paper in a few local conferences on Sorting of Data using Hadoop. For my final year project created an application for ‚ÄúPrivacy Preserved Ride Sharing for Autonomous Vehicles in BigData Era‚Äù.  The idea revolves around the concept of allowing people with cars to share their ride with others who use the same route of commute saving fuel and optimizing the cost of travel significantly. Issues like safety, cost efficiency and time management was addressed in the project.  During my final semester I was provided with a prodigious opportunity to intern at BNY Mellon, Chennai. There I learnt the importance of time management, risk management, leadership skills, working as a team, and communication skills. Being trained by experienced professionals. After the internship, I was provided with a full time job offer in the same company as an entry level application developer. Was a part of the Global Market Technologies team, Phoenix, where we manage the technical aspects of banking transactions across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. I developed technical skills like Spring, angular and Java advanced and non-technical skills like collaborating with other developers from different parts of the world and successfully navigating through a crisis. When I am not working, I teach young girls to code in C, C++ and Java.  I earned my undergraduate degree in computer science engineering with a ‚ÄòFirst class‚Äô. Prior to that in high school I was a topper maintaining 95% consistently, scoring a centum in my mathematics paper in class X board exams and topped the computer science paper in high school. Trained professionally in classical dance and music and gave performances all over the country. The most notable one being the performance for the Chief Minister of the state. My first computer instigated my interest in technologies, high school and college provided me first-hand knowledge and experience on it, and corporate gave me an insight on how a company works. But there is an undying urge in me to give something back to the world that has changed the course of life of billions of people and the only way through which I know for sure can create a huge impact is through computer technology. My passion is new age computer programming languages that helps create optimized and high performance applications. In the near future I see myself starting my own company that outsources high end applications. The University of British Columbia has been at the forefront of education giving birth to many world leaders. With the highly renowned faculty, quality infrastructure, especially the Internet Research Lab that is highly fascinating, and like-minded students with a similar passion, I am optimistic about my start-up. It would be an honor to work with professors Dinesh Pai, Giuseppe Carneni and Cristina Conati. Dr.Conati‚Äôs paper on ‚ÄòEye-Tracking for User Modeling in Exploratory Learning Environments: an Empirical Evaluation‚Äô was quite inspiring as it brought to light a whole new insight in learning environments. I am confident that I have all the required skills needed to thrive in graduate school and become a part of our university‚Äôs culture and environment. I hope to meet the founders of great companies and get inspiration from their journey and have hands-on experience in the field. Our grandfather advised us to ‚ÄòAlways be in the game‚Äô. I did not understand the true meaning of it until a few years after he passed. But now I am ready for it and the first level would be an education from one of the best schools in the world. Thank you for considering my application.  ",,0
