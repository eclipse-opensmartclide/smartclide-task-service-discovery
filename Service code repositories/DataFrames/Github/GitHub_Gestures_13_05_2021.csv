First of all, real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm is applied to trace the moving hand and to extract the hand region, and then motion analysis is performed to characterize the temporal features. We then extract the tracker position from the image. This tracker posture is recognized as a hand gesture. Now it is matched with a set of pre-defined gestures to know its meaning. Before matching gesture, preprocessing is performed to remove other part of human body and to select only part of hand showing some useful gesture.",,11

In its present version, the toolkit contains generic algorithms for the recognition of isolated handwritten shapes such as pen gestures and handwritten characters, captured using a stylus or electronic pen or finger, using devices such as TabletPCs, PDAs, stylus-equipped SmartPhones, external tablets, notes taking devices, digital pen and paper, to name some common ones.  In addition to supporting the creation of new recognizers for arbitrary sets of shapes and new scripts, LipiTk also contains ready-to-use recognizers for common character sets, standalone demos and pen-based applications, as well as standalone tools for data collection and annotation. In addition, on this site, you will also find project ideas, and resources related to online handwriting recognition.  For more information, please refer to the Overview and the FAQ sections.",,8
