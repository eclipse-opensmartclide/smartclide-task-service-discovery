Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. Chat bots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centres and Internet gaming. Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment. In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individuals‚Äô lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff. This healthcare chatbot system will help hospitals to provide healthcare support online 24 x 7, it answers deep as well as general questions. It also helps to generate leads and automatically delivers the information of leads to sales. By asking the questions in series it helps patients by guiding what exactly he/she is looking for. ",,24

The dataset contains Commercial Insurance claims, and a small fraction of Medicaid and Medicare payments for dually eligible people. The primary purpose of this assignment is to test machine learning (ML) skills in a real case analysis setting. You are expected to clean and process data and then apply various ML techniques like Linear and no linear models like regularized regression, MARS, and Partitioning methods. You are expected to use at least two of R, Python and JMP software.  Data details:  Medical claims file for 2016 contains ~17 millions rows and ~60 columns of data, containing ~6.5 million individual medical claims. These claims are all commercial claims that were filed by healthcare providers in 2016 in the state of NH. These claims were ~88% for residents of NH and the remaining for out of state visitors who sought care in NH. Each claim consists of one or more line items, each indicating a procedure done during the doctor‚Äôs visit. Two columns indicating Billed amount and the Paid amount for the care provided, are of primary interest. The main objective is to predict ‚ÄúPaid amount per procedure‚Äù by mapping a plethora of features available in the dataset. It is also an expectation that you would create new features using the existing ones or external data sources.  Objectives: Step 1: Take a random sample of 1 million unique claims, such that all line items related to each claim are included in the sample. This will result in a little less than 3 million rows of data.  Step 2: Clean up the data, understand the distributions, and create new features if necessary.  Step 3: Run predictive models using validation method of your choice.  Step 4: Write a descriptive report (less than 10 pages) describing the process and your findings.

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent medical conditions in people today Hospital readmission for diabetic patients is a major concern in the United States. Over $250 million dollars was spent on treatment of readmitted diabetic inpatients in 2011 alone. Diabetes is chronic and does not have any specific cure.   Objective:- Hospital readmission rates for certain conditions are now considered an indicator of hospital quality, and also affect the cost of care adversely. Hospital readmissions of diabetic patients are expensive as hospitals face penalties if their readmission rate is higher than expected and reflects the inadequacies in health care system. For these reasons, it is important for the hospitals to improve focus on reducing readmission rates. Identify the key factors that influence readmission for diabetes and to predict the probability of patient readmission.   Approach:- The dataset chosen is that available on the UCI website which contains the patient data for the past 10 years for 130 hospitals. The code has been written in Python using different libraries like scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib etc. Different machine learning techniques for classification and regression like Logistic regression, Random forest etc have been used to achieve the objective.

In Kenya, there are growing concerns about mental health among young people, particularly university students that face a challenging and unique conflation of stressors that put them at risk of challenges like depression and substance abuse.  From the use of app-based solutions for screening to electronically delivered therapies, the use of technologies including machine learning and AI will potentially transform the delivery of mental health services in the coming years.  The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that classifies statements and questions expressed by university students in Kenya when speaking about the mental health challenges they struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse.  This solution will be used for a prototype of a mental health chatbot designed specifically for university students.

0,https://github.com/mistersharmaa/BreastCancerPrediction.git,"Breast cancer has the second highest mortality rate in women next to lung cancer. As per clinical statistics, 1 in every 8 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. However, periodic clinical check-ups and self-tests help in early detection and thereby significantly increase the chances of survival. Invasive detection techniques cause rupture of the tumor, accelerating the spread of cancer to adjoining areas. Hence, there arises the need for a more robust, fast, accurate, and efficient non-invasive cancer detection system. Early detection can give patients more treatment options. In order to detect signs of cancer, breast tissue from biopsies is stained to enhance the nuclei and cytoplasm for microscopic examination. Then, pathologists evaluate the extent of any abnormal structural variation to determine whether there are tumors. Architectural Distortion (AD) is a very subtle contraction of the breast tissue and may represent the earliest sign of cancer. Since it is very likely to be unnoticed by radiologists, several approaches have been proposed over the years but none using deep learning techniques. AI will become a transformational force in healthcare and soon, computer vision models will be able to get a higher accuracy when researchers have the access to more medical imaging datasets. The application of machine learning models for prediction and prognosis of disease development has become an irrevocable part of cancer studies aimed at improving the subsequent therapy and management of patients. The application of machine learning models for accurate prediction of survival time in breast cancer on the basis of clinical data is the main objective.  We have developed a computer vision model to detect breast cancer in histopathological images. Two classes will be used in this project: Benign and Malignant",,6

See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet ‚Äî September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  ‚ò∞ Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group\'s work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff\'s exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by ‚Äúcards‚Äù which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C\'s payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo\'s Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group\'s first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals ‚Äìpresently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements‚Äì and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C\'s auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C\'s Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‚Äòmodules‚Äô. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources ‚Äî with different types of channel layout ‚Äî are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We\'re now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C\'s Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C\'s Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C\'s MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright ¬© 2019 W3C ¬Æ (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",,6

Each patient that enters the ER represents a new combination of history (including environmental factors and health history), presenting symptoms, and potential diagnoses. HCPs are already overloaded and often do not have sufficient time to keep up with the current literature regarding treatments, diseases, and the interactions between them. Our plan is to create a tool which can be used to provide these HCPs with real-time, accurate reports of research relevant to each patient who enters the hospital. By linking the intake records of ER patients to relevant PubMed articles that can provide HCPs with clinical decision support, this project aims to increase the quality of care that patients receive, while making physicians and other healthcare providers feel supported in the challenging processes of diagnosis and treatment.  There is currently no readily-available software that will link Electronic Health Records to relevant scientific articles. While there are existing tools which summarize articles and extract keywords, they do not have the capability to combine these with medical terminology to identify clinically relevant information. Our approach will identify actionable keywords in emergency room intake summaries and use these tokens to provide support in clinical decision making by delivering articles that provide information relevant to a patient‚Äôs condition.",,5
0,https://github.com/sushruthreddygade/ituHMS.git,"Purpose  The purpose of this project is to apply and learn advanced software engineering   concepts gathering requirements for a software application that schedules the   hospital personnel and then derive use cases from them. This involves reviewing   of already existing software and learning website and derive requirements and   use cases based on the website primary features. The project also encompasses   construction of, sequence diagram, design class diagram, Collaboration diagrams   and other UML modeling diagrams based on the derived use cases. At the end,   high level planning is done for the whole project based on derived use cases by   Agile efforts estimation technique.  Scope   The project will consist of developing personnel scheduling software. Modules of   the website include a login feature, a schedule checker and a schedule planner.   Our innovative 100% web-based Scheduling & Open Shift Management (OSM)   product can help managers efficiently schedule their staff, and also lets the staff   help managers fill open shifts online, see schedules and changes, request time-  off, swap shifts, etc, etc. All schedules, changes, approvals, and alerts not only   happen online in real-time, but also are sent out as emails and text messages to   cell phones. Our Software can cut manager time wasted on scheduling tasks by   50% or more and let them get back to MANAGING! Introduction to HMSS  When workforce includes hundreds of employees, open shifts are inevitable.   Without the right skills-based workforce management tools in place, nurse managers   and staffing managers spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to fill scheduling   gaps. Not only is this inefficient, but it leads to increased costs and reduced employee   satisfaction.  Advantages of having online scheduling system  2.1.   ‚óè Save Money  Reduce premium labor costs by leveraging the most cost-effective, qualified staff   to fill open shifts. Stop wasting time you don‚Äôt have on scheduling. Decrease the   time it takes you to create a weekly schedule for your team by over 75 percent   with HMSS.  ‚óè Save Time  Save countless hours using instant communication strategies to fill open shifts.  ‚óè Keep Workers Happy  Increase employee satisfaction by empowering them to choose when they want   to work based on experience, competencies, and skills.  ‚óè Faster, Easier Scheduling  Healthcare staff scheduling has never been easier. Spend minutes instead of   hours organizing shifts for your nurses and other medical staff.  ‚óè Monitor Attendance  Hospital Management System (Personal Scheduling System) ‚Äì SWE 600 (Fall 2015) Prof.                               Instructors: Dr. R.   Riehle & Q Asghar   See which employees are coming in late or missing shifts. Send shift reminders   automatically to make sure everyone is on the same page.  ‚óè Give Staff More Independence  Take some work off your own plate with collaborative healthcare staff   scheduling options. Allow your employees to request shift trades and swaps on   their own so you don‚Äôt have to micromanage them.  ‚óè Avoid Human Error  Humans make mistakes, but HMSS doesn‚Äôt. If you forget to fill a shift or   overbook one, the software immediately notifies you of your error, allowing you   to rectify it right away.  ‚óè Create Perfect Timesheets  Export perfect timesheets to create perfect attendance and work reports. Better   healthcare staff scheduling means easier payroll processing as well.  To deliver the best care possible to patients, we must begin with the best   possible workforce management solution for our staff. With HMSS, we help   control labor costs, minimize compliance risk, improve workforce productivity,   and deliver quality, cost-effective care. Here‚Äôs how:  ‚Ä¢ Physician coverage scheduling enables the effective and equitable deployment   of physicians and other clinician providers ‚Äì your group, your rules, to build your   schedules  ‚Ä¢ Advanced staffing supports the safest and most appropriate assignment of   caregiver staff to patients, and balances workload distribution in the best   interests of patients and staff  ‚Ä¢ Intelligently forecast volume to build optimal schedules helps ensure proper   staff coverage for every shift, every day, across your entire organization  ‚Ä¢ On-demand visibility with labor analytics controls labor costs and allows   organizations to make evidence-based decisions  ‚Ä¢ Mobile management supports paperless workflow and employee self-service for   your on-the-go workforce",,5

A good example of such a task is the detection of genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome or Hemophilia. Usually, clinicians are doing chromosome analysis using the karyotype to detect such disorders. The main contribution of the current article consists of introducing a new approach called KaryML Framework, which is extending our previous research: KarySOM: An Unsupervised Learning based Approach for Human Karyotyping using Self-Organizing Maps . Our major goal is to provide a new method for an automated karyotyping system using unsupervised techniques.

These problems are they key reasons which makes India to succumb in International Rankings despite the presence of universal healthcare. 1. Long waiting time in OPD lines(It leads to both financial and mortal consequences most people tend to avoid visiting doctors till the situation is unbearable). 2. Malpractices in Healthcare Industry. 3. Delays in specialised care(Most government hospitals sends all patients to a general physician first and only then they are further forwarded to specialised care). 4.  Lack of proper medical records(These are extremely helpful in the cases of emergencies). Our Solution : We bring out one single solution called Shack, we believe that shack will not just only solve the above mentioned problems but also help us achieve  maximum out of our current Healthcare Infrastructure. Shack is a technology which can be used to book speciality specific appointments after accounting for the symptoms(patients only need to report their symptoms   and shack will do the rest), hence solving our problem statement 3. SHack will maintain an e-record for all the symptoms presented and hence solving the problem no. 2 and 4. This online portal will make it possible to book appointments on a particular date and time(for specialised care, similar to nordic nations) hence aiding in crowd control in OPDs(hence solving the statement no 1 ) . Key Features of our Solution: 1. Easy to use even for the unprivileged members of the society, the login process will be simple and all details will fetched just through 1 touch.(We are using an rfId card to demonstrate this but in real life implementation we will switch to fingerprints(Aadhar), we are using rfid since we couldn't get access to aadhar api). 2. Most of the times general populations isn't too aware of the medical procedures done then and hence are not able to ask suitable questions or consider alternatives.

According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims. Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day. Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are: a) Billing for services that were not provided. b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service. c) Misrepresenting the service provided. d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided. e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered. Problem Statement The goal of this project is to "" predict the potentially fraudulent providers "" based on the claims filed by them. Along with this, we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behavior of potentially fraud providers. further, we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider\'s claims to understand the future behavior of providers. About the dataset : For the purpose of this project, we are considering Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims and Beneficiary details of each provider. Lets s see their details : A) Inpatient Data This data provides insights about the claims filed for those patients who are admitted in the hospitals. It also provides additional details like their admission and discharge dates and admit d diagnosis code.

0,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons.git,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain‚Äìmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors\' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There‚Äôs nothing artificial about AI...It‚Äôs inspired by people, it‚Äôs created by people, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.‚Äù[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so","aryia-behroziuan,artificial-intelligence,wikipedia,an-ann,neural-network,android,bootstrap,csharp,deep-learning,expressjs,firebase",3

The advent of web enabled (or smart) phones and pad computers makes it possible to access information and send and receive messages anywhere there is a cell signal or wireless network. Mobile communication technologies have spread with remarkable speed. By the end of 2011, more than 5.6 billion people worldwide were using cell phones and smart phone purchases had outpaced computers. Physicians are embracing the technology.  HIPAA 2018 Changes In this HIPAA session we will be discussing HIPAA 2018 Changes taking place in Washington with the Health and Human Services when it comes to the enforcement of the HIPAA regulations already on the books as well as some step-by-step discussions on the audit method and some current functions regarding HIPAA cases (both in courtrooms and from live audits).  Attend this Session   What not to Use  Do not use the patient\'s name, initials, or medical record number in the subject line of an email. Also, do not use direct patient identifiers in the message content. This includes:  Names Phone numbers Fax numbers Electronic mail addresses Social Security numbers Medical record numbers Health plan beneficiary numbers Account numbers and other personal details HIPAA - Texting & Emailing in 2018 With the introduction of smartphones, emails have become the even more accessible form of communication. In conjunction with email comes the issue of security and them being intercepted and read by unintended persons. Precautions and steps are to be taken at every step of the way. So for a Healthcare concern or a business associate, it\'s a key to maximize patient communication tools while protecting itself and the organization from government penalties and patient lawsuits.  Attend this Session  Limit the amount of personal health record information you include in electronic communication. Don\'t include any highly sensitive information, such as: Mental Illness or Developmental Disability HIV/AIDS Testing or Treatment Communicable Diseases Venereal Disease(s) Substance (i.e., alcohol or drug) Abuse Abuse of an Adult with a Disability Sexual Assault and other sensitive details HIPAA Privacy Officer: Module 1 HIPAA Privacy Officer Training will uncover all HIPAA and HITECH expectations in protecting patient and member\'s right to privacy and the confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI) as you engage in treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO) services.  Attend this Session  What you need to know before you hit ""send""          The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits healthcare providers to use e-mail to discuss health issues and treatment with their patients, provided they apply reasonable safeguards when doing so. These precautions are intended to prevent unintentional disclosures of ePHI and may include:  Double and triple-checking the e-mail address to ensure accuracy before sending Sending an e-mail to the patient to confirm the address prior to sending any e-mail with ePHI Limiting the type or amount of information disclosed through e-mail, including ePHI Encrypting the e-mail prior to sending Alerting the patient to the relative risks of using unencrypted e-mail to communicate sensitive information, such as the potential for interception by a third party; having the e-mail read by a person with whom the patient has shared their e-mail login and password; accessing private e-mail on a public computer, such as in a library or on a shared computer at work HIPAA Privacy Officer Module: 2 HIPAA Privacy Officer Training will cover all ongoing activities of a Privacy Program related to the development, implementation, maintenance of, and adherence to the organization\'s policies and procedures covering the privacy of, and access to, patient health information in compliance with federal and state laws and the healthcare organization\'s information privacy practices.  Attend this Session  Privacy and Security Require passwords and current antivirus (malware) protection for all devices (pads, laptops, desktops, smart phones) including providers\' personal devices. Most smart phone and pad computer users do not use a password, defer to the pre-programmed password or use a simplistic password that is easy to guess. Develop and enforce password requirements. The portability of smart phones and pad computers makes them highly vulnerable to theft, loss and electronic snooping. Inventory all portable devices used by providers to communicate protected health information. Ensure the ability to lock or remote wipe the devices if lost or stolen.          Most of the suggestions on e-mailing with patients also apply to text messaging (SMS), where applicable. It should be noted that, while a text message cannot be encrypted, there are third party vendors that offer so-called ""HIPAA-compliant"" text messaging services, which address the Person or Entity Authentication and the Transmission Security standards of the Security Rule.           It is important for practices, providers and patients to understand the risks and benefits of communicating health care information electronically and to mitigate and manage the risks appropriately.....https://www.complyarena.com/articledetails/42",,2

While Kenya has a mental illness prevalence rate that is comparable to that of high-income countries, there are still less than 500 healthcare professionals serving the country.  In Kenya, there are growing concerns about mental health among young people, particularly university students that face a challenging and unique conflation of stressors that put them at risk of challenges like depression and substance abuse.  From the use of app-based solutions for screening to electronically delivered therapies, the use of technologies including machine learning and AI will potentially transform the delivery of mental health services in the coming years.  The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that classifies statements and questions expressed by university students in Kenya when speaking about the mental health challenges they struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse.  This solution will be used for a prototype of a mental health chatbot designed specifically for university students.

Now, Apple and its products certainly do not need much introduction and they are actually the apple of each owner‚Äôs eye.  Recently Apple introduced an enhanced feature of Portrait Mode to iPhone 7 Plus users with its 10.1 iOS update.  Apple\'s iPhone 7 Plus comes with a dual lens setup in which one is the telephoto lens and the other is a wide-angle lens. So with Portrait mode one gets a DSLR style portrait with a ""Bokeh"" effect where the objects come sharply in focus while the rest of the background is blurred. Using this mode you can focus on one object in distance and then click a picture. Portrait mode creates a shallow depth of everything and puts the subject in focus while all everything else is blurred.  Apple\'s iPhone 7 Plus comes with 12-megapixel rear cameras with optical image stabilization and f/1.8 aperture and a new 6 element lens. It also comes with an optical zoom at 2X and 10X digital zoom for photos. One can use both the cameras in the Portrait mode to give a professional touch to the pics one clicks.

0,https://github.com/TVSNEXT/Transforming-Healthcare-through-IoT.git,"Look around and you will find people with smart devices that track their every move, calculate their intake and gives them trends on this data.  Primitively, Caregivers and hospitals were using telemetry to remotely gather data for improving patient care.  The primary aim of preventive healthcare was to deliver personalized care, improve patient care while reducing costs. However, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving the future of healthcare for better outcomes, improving efficiency and making healthcare more affordable as caretakers are increasingly resorting to more self- care due to increased awareness.  To get there, healthcare providers must make use of technology in a more systematic way.  The Scope of IoT is getting bigger and better in:      Preventive healthcare: by use of wearables.     Patient tracking: in monitoring patient movement and health analysis.     Geriatric care: in tracking Senior citizens which is a large market for IoT, medical devices.     Real-time location: in tracking medical devices, people and asset movement.  Gartner believes that 30% of smart wearables will be unobtrusive to the eye by 2017. it is predicted that the revenue from smart wearable devices will generate $22.9 billion by 2020.  Experts from P&S Market research expect that the healthcare Internet of Things industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.6 percent between 2015 and 2020.  The rising need for advanced healthcare combined with the requirements of Affordable Care Act (ACA), technology in the industry is expected to grow through 2020  Wearables for preventive health analysis  Imagine a wearable used for preventive health analysis.  The term wearable in health parlance should not be restricted to just fitness tracking devices worn in the wrist that are used to monitor personal health.  By and far, this term should go beyond tracking of physical activities; it could be used as a communication device or it could even be a device that interacts with other devices like an Apple watch, track patients‚Äô body conditions, sleep patterns or any other critical information which may require immediate care.  It could be a device in the body, on the body or near the body like a medical app that helps track personal health;  Some of the industry medical apps that are already disrupting the healthcare market are      Philips‚Äô Medication Dispensing Service     Airfinder     Boiron Medicine Finder App     Future Path Medical‚Äôs Urosense     Digital Hospitals making headway  Healthcare is increasingly leveraging modern technology and digital hospitals are making headway such as the Humber River Hospital in Toronto Canada and the Medical Center at Mission Bay San Francisco. Innovative approaches towards engaging robots in the radiology and other departments are also disrupting the way healthcare is delivered.  Deakin University Australia, in partnership with Telstra Australia, has developed haptics-enabled robots that can perform ultrasound diagnostics remotely. This means the patient need not be in the same place as the sonographer conducting the ultrasound.  IoMT for improved healthcare  There were 165,000 mobile healthcare apps as of November 2015 and the mobile app marketplace is expected to grow 15 times faster, according to a survey.  Another survey shows users expect digital healthcare services to be able to communicate with doctors via their smartphones, monitor health and collaborate with care givers with ease.  IoMT is slowly and steadily reducing human intervention and dependency to provide early diagnosis and contributing to improved healthcare in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which focus on certified EHR (Electronic Health Record) to enhance efficiency and quality of patient care.  Conclusion:  With the cost of Hardware coming down, software enabling devices to talk to multiple devices across platforms is going to redefine the way people take care of their health.  The biggest change is going to be in Preventive Healthcare, making it the biggest gamechanger.",,1
