She was locked away in a castle guarded                           by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

One                 of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan\'s                 hands, and her cage drops on Donkey\'s head.

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.                 Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared                 for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He                 quickly hides behind Shrek.

The guard tucks tail                 and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and                 begins walking back to his cottage.

They was trippin\' over themselves                           like babes in the woods. That really                           made me feel good to see that.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s great. Really.                                       DONKEY                          Man, it\'s good to be free.                                       SHREK                          Now, why don\'t you go celebrate your                           freedom with your own friends? Hmm?                                                                  DONKEY                          But, uh, I don\'t have any friends. And                           I\'m not goin\' out there by myself. Hey,                           wait a minute! I got a great idea! I\'ll                           stick with you. You\'re mean, green,                           fightin\' machine. Together we\'ll scare                           the spit out of anybody that crosses                           us.                  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very                 loudly.                                        DONKEY                          Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you                           don\'t mind me sayin\', if that don\'t                           work, your breath certainly will get                           the job done, \'cause you definitely                           need some Tic Tacs or something, \'cause                           you breath stinks! You almost burned                           the hair outta my nose, just like the                           time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey                           continues to talk, so Shrek removes                           his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten                           berries. I had strong gases leaking                           out of my butt that day.                                        SHREK                          Why are you following me?                                       DONKEY                          I\'ll tell you why. (singing) \'Cause                           I\'m all alone, There\'s no one here beside                           me, My problems have all gone, There\'s                           no one to deride me, But you gotta have                           faith...                                        SHREK                          Stop singing! It\'s no wonder you don\'t                           have any friends.                                        DONKEY                          Wow. Only a true friend would be that                           cruelly honest.                                        SHREK                          Listen, little donkey. Take a look at                           me. What am I?                                        DONKEY                          (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really                           tall?                                        SHREK                          No! I\'m an ogre! You know. ""Grab your                           torch and pitchforks."" Doesn\'t that                           bother you?                                        DONKEY                          Nope.                                       SHREK                          Really?                                       DONKEY                          Really, really.                                       SHREK                          Oh.                                       DONKEY                          Man, I like you. What\'s you name?                                       SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek? Well, you know what I like about                           you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don\'t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me                           thing. I like that. I respect that,                           Shrek. You all right. (They come over                           a hill and you can see Shrek\'s cottage.)                           Whoa! Look at that. Who\'d want to live                           in place like that?                                        SHREK                          That would be my home.                                       DONKEY                          Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.                           You know you are quite a decorator.                           It\'s amazing what you\'ve done with such                           a modest budget. I like that boulder.                           That is a nice boulder. I guess you                           don\'t entertain much, do you?                                        SHREK                          I like my privacy.                                       DONKEY                          You know, I do too. That\'s another thing                           we have in common. Like I hate it when                           you got somebody in your face. You\'ve                           trying to give them a hint, and they                           won\'t leave. There\'s that awkward silence.                           (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, what?                                       DONKEY                          Can I stay with you, please?                                       SHREK                          (sarcastically) Of course!                                       DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Please! I don\'t wanna go back there!                           You don\'t know what it\'s like to be                           considered a freak. (pause while he                           looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.                           But that\'s why we gotta stick together.                           You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!                                                                  SHREK                          Okay! Okay! But one night only.                                       DONKEY                          Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)                                                                  SHREK                          What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto                           a chair.) No! No!                                        DONKEY                          This is gonna be fun! We can stay up                           late, swappin\' manly stories, and in                           the mornin\' I\'m makin\' waffles.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                                       DONKEY                          Where do, uh, I sleep?                                       SHREK                          (irritated) Outside!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, well, I guess that\'s cool. I mean,                           I don\'t know you, and you don\'t know                           me, so I guess outside is best, you                           know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek                           slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do                           like the outdoors. I\'m a donkey. I was                           born outside. I\'ll just be sitting by                           myself outside, I guess, you know. By                           myself, outside. I\'m all alone...there\'s                           no one here beside me...                  SHREK\'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                 Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights                 a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a                 noise. He stands up with a huff.                                        SHREK                          (to Donkey) I thought I told you to                           stay outside.                                        DONKEY                          (from the window) I am outside.                 There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that                 made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns                 and spots 3 blind mice on his table.                                        BLIND MOUSE1                          Well, gents, it\'s a far cry from the                           farm, but what choice do we have?                                                                  BLIND MOUSE2                          It\'s not home, but it\'ll do just fine.                                                                  GORDO                          (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.                                                                  SHREK                          Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes                           and lands on his shoulder.)                                        GORDO                          I found some cheese. (bites Shrek\'s                           ear)                                        SHREK                          Ow!                                       GORDO                          Blah! Awful stuff.                                       BLIND MOUSE1                          Is that you, Gordo?                                       GORDO                          How did you know?                                       SHREK                          Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are                           you doing in my house? (He gets bumped                           from behind and he drops the mice.)                           Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves                           with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,                           no, no. Dead broad off the table.                                                                  DWARF                          Where are we supposed to put her? The                           bed\'s taken.                                        SHREK                          Huh?                 Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.                 The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at                 him.                                        BIG BAD WOLF                          What?                 TIME LAPSE                 Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging                 him to the front door.                                        SHREK                          I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I\'m                           a terrifying ogre! What do I have to                           do get a little privacy? (He opens the                           front door to throw the Wolf out and                           he sees that all the collected Fairy                           Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,                           no. No! No!                  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his                 pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing                 flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.                                                        SHREK                          What are you doing in my swamp? (this                           echoes and everyone falls silent.)                                            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a                 tent.                                        SHREK                          All right, get out of here. All of you,                           move it! Come on! Let\'s go! Hapaya!                           Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more                           dwarves run inside the house) No, no!                           No, no. Not there. Not there. (they                           shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to                           look at Donkey)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, don\'t look at me.

SHREK                          (flabbergasted) By who?                                       LITTLE PIG                          Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed                           and he...signed an eviction notice.

Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, I do. I know where he is.                                       SHREK                          Does anyone else know where to find                           him? Anyone at all?                                        DONKEY                          Me!

Do not get comfortable.                           Your welcome is officially worn out.                           In fact, I\'m gonna see this guy Farquaad                           right now and get you all off my land                           and back where you came from! (Pause.

DONKEY                          All right, that\'s what I like to hear,                           man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart                           friends, off on a whirlwind big-city                           adventure. I love it!

I can\'t wait to get                           on the road again.                                        SHREK                          What did I say about singing?                                       DONKEY                          Can I whistle?

SHREK                          All right, hum it.                 Donkey begins to hum \'On the Road Again\'.                 DULOC - KITCHEN                 A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He\'s continually                 dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.                                        FARQUAAD                          That\'s enough. He\'s ready to talk.                                            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down                 onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the                 table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes                 up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.                                                        FARQUAAD                          (he picks up the Gingerbread Man\'s legs                           and plays with them) Run, run, run,                           as fast as you can. You can\'t catch                           me. I\'m the gingerbread man.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          You are a monster.                                       FARQUAAD                          I\'m not the monster here. You are. You                           and the rest of that fairy tale trash,                           poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell                           me! Where are the others?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Eat me!

FARQUAAD                          I\'ve tried to be fair to you creatures.                           Now my patience has reached its end!                           Tell me or I\'ll...(he makes as if to                           pull off the Gingerbread Man\'s buttons)                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          No, no, not the buttons.

Who\'s hiding them?                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          Okay, I\'ll tell you. Do you know the                           muffin man?                                        FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?

FARQUAAD                          Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives                           on Drury Lane?

FARQUAAD                          She\'s married to the muffin man.                 The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.                                       HEAD GUARD                          My lord! We found it.                                       FARQUAAD                          Then what are you waiting for? Bring                           it in.                  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.                 They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic                 Mirror.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          (in awe) Ohhhh...

But don\'t let that cool you off. She\'s                           a loaded pistol who likes pina colads                           and getting caught in the rain.

That\'s the place.                                       SHREK                          Do you think maybe he\'s compensating                           for something? (He laughs, but then                           groans as Donkey doesn\'t get the joke.                           He continues walking through the parking                           lot.)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.                                       MAN                          Hurry, darling. We\'re late. Hurry.                                                                  SHREK                          Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing                           a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,                           screams and begins running through the                           rows of rope to get to the front gate                           to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.                           Look, I\'m not gonna eat you. I just                           - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins                           walking straight through the rows. The                           attendant runs into a wall and falls                           down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then                           continue on into DuLoc.)                  DULOC                 They look around but all is quiet.                                       SHREK                          It\'s quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?                                                                  DONKEY                          Hey, look at this!                 Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box                 marked \'Information\'. The music winds up and then the box doors                 open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin                 to sing.                                        WOODEN PEOPLE                          Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town                                            Here we have some rules                 Let us lay them down                 Don\'t make waves, stay in line                 And we\'ll get along fine                 DuLoc is perfect place                 Please keep off of the grass                 Shine your shoes, wipe your... face                 DuLoc is, DuLoc is                 DuLoc is perfect place.                 Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek\'s picture.                                       DONKEY                          Wow! Let\'s do that again! (makes ready                           to run over and pull the lever again)                                                                  SHREK                          (grabs Donkey\'s tail and holds him still)                           No. No. No, no, no! No.                  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.                                       FARQUAAD                          Brave knights. You are the best and                           brightest in all the land. Today one                           of you shall prove himself...                  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena                 Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.                                        SHREK                          All right. You\'re going the right way                           for a smacked bottom.                                        DONKEY                          Sorry about that.                                       FARQUAAD                          That champion shall have the honor -                           - no, no - - the privilege to go forth                           and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona                           from the fiery keep of the dragon. If                           for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,                           the first runner-up will take his place                           and so on and so forth. Some of you                           may die, but it\'s a sacrifice I am willing                           to make. (cheers) Let the tournament                           begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is                           that? It\'s hideous!                                        SHREK                          (turns to look at Donkey and then back                           at Farquaad) Ah, that\'s not very nice.                           It\'s just a donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who                           kills the ogre will be named champion!                           Have it him!                                        MEN                          Get him!                                       SHREK                          Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps                           into a table where there are mugs of                           beer)                                        CROWD                          Go ahead! Get him!                                       SHREK                          (holds up a mug of beer) Can\'t we just                           settle this over a pint?                                        CROWD                          Kill the beast!                                       SHREK                          No? All right then. (drinks the beer)                           Come on!                  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel                 of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the                 other men and wetting the ground. It\'s like mud now. Shrek slides                 past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.                 As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger                 beer barrels. It breaks free of it\'s ropes and begins to roll.                 Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much                 fighting going on here I\'m not going to go into detail. Suffice                 to say that Shrek kicks butt.                                        DONKEY                          Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!                 Shrek comes over and bangs a man\'s head up against Donkeys. Shrek                 gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.                                        SHREK                          Yeah!                 A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time                 and sees him.                                        WOMAN                          The chair! Give him the chair!                 Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men                 are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding                 sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.                                        SHREK                          Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you                           very much! I\'m here till Thursday. Try                           the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)                  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on                 Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Shall I give the order, sir?                                       FARQUAAD                          No, I have a better idea. People of                           DuLoc, I give you our champion!                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FARQUAAD                          Congratulations, ogre. You\'re won the                           honor of embarking on a great and noble                           quest.                                        SHREK                          Quest? I\'m already in a quest, a quest                           to get my swamp back.                                        FARQUAAD                          Your swamp?                                       SHREK                          Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those                           fairy tale creatures!                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. All right, ogre. I\'ll make you                           a deal. Go on this quest for me, and                           I\'ll give you your swamp back.                                        SHREK                          Exactly the way it was?                                       FARQUAAD                          Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.                                                                  SHREK                          And the squatters?                                       FARQUAAD                          As good as gone.                                       SHREK                          What kind of quest?                 Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field                 heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.                                        DONKEY                          Let me get this straight. You\'re gonna                           go fight a dragon and rescue a princess                           just so Farquaad will give you back                           a swamp which you only don\'t have because                           he filled it full of freaks in the first                           place. Is that about right?                                        SHREK                          You know, maybe there\'s a good reason                           donkeys shouldn\'t talk.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t get it. Why don\'t you just pull                           some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle                           him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds                           his bones to make your bread, the whole                           ogre trip.                                        SHREK                          Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have                           decapitated an entire village and put                           their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,                           cut open their spleen and drink their                           fluids. Does that sound good to you?                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh, no, not really, no.                                       SHREK                          For your information, there\'s a lot                           more to ogres than people think.

SHREK                          You know, I think I preferred your humming.                                                                  DONKEY                          Do you have a tissue or something? I\'m                           making a mess. Just the word parfait                           make me start slobbering.                  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through                 a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying                 to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,                 so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.                  DRAGON\'S KEEP                 Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that\'s supposed to                 house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.                                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?                           You gotta warn somebody before you just                           crack one off. My mouth was open and                           everything.                                        SHREK                          Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you\'d                           be dead. (sniffs) It\'s brimstone. We                           must be getting close.                                        DONKEY                          Yeah, right, brimstone. Don\'t be talking                           about it\'s the brimstone. I know what                           I smell. It wasn\'t no brimstone. It                           didn\'t come off no stone neither.                                            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There                 is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where                 the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very                 foreboding.                                        SHREK                          Sure, it\'s big enough, but look at the                           location. (laughs...then the laugh turns                           into a groan)                                        DONKEY                          Uh, Shrek?

DONKEY                          Well, I have a bit of a confession to                           make. Donkeys don\'t have layers. We                           wear our fear right out there on our                           sleeves.                                        SHREK                          Wait a second. Donkeys don\'t have sleeves.                                                                  DONKEY                          You know what I mean.                                       SHREK                          You can\'t tell me you\'re afraid of heights.                                                                  DONKEY                          No, I\'m just a little uncomfortable                           about being on a rickety bridge over                           a boiling like of lava!

Shut ... up.                           Now go over there and see if you can                           find any stairs.                                        DONKEY                          Stairs?

I\'ll find those stairs.                           I\'ll whip their butt too. Those stairs                           won\'t know which way they\'re goin\'.

I\'ve mastered the                           stairs. I wish I had a step right here.                           I\'d step all over it.

SHREK                          Well, at least we know where the princess                           is, but where\'s the...

I know you probably hear this all time                           from your food, but you must bleach,                           \'cause that is one dazzling smile you                           got there.

(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes                           at him) What\'s the matter with you?                           You got something in your eye? Ohh.                           Oh. Oh. Man, I\'d really love to stay,                           but you know, I\'m, uh...(the dragon                           blows a smoke ring in the shape of a                           heart right at him, and he coughs) I\'m                           an asthmatic, and I don\'t know if it\'d                           work out if you\'re gonna blow smoke                           rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him                           up with her teeth and carries him off)                           No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!                  FIONA\'S ROOM                 Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona                 so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She                 then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off                 the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.                 Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for                 a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders                 and shakes her away.                                        FIONA                          Oh! Oh!                                       SHREK                          Wake up!                                       FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          Are you Princess Fiona?                                       FIONA                          I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s nice. Now let\'s go!                                       FIONA                          But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our                           first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,                           romantic moment?                                        SHREK                          Yeah, sorry, lady. There\'s no time.                                                                  FIONA                          Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should                           sweep me off my feet out yonder window                           and down a rope onto your valiant steed.                                                                  SHREK                          You\'ve had a lot of time to plan this,                           haven\'t you?                                        FIONA                          (smiles) Mm-hmm.                 Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down                 the hallway.                                        FIONA                          But we have to savor this moment! You                           could recite an epic poem for me. A                           ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!                                                                  SHREK                          I don\'t think so.                                       FIONA                          Can I at least know the name of my champion?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       FIONA                          Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds                           out a handkerchief) I pray that you                           take this favor as a token of my gratitude.                                                                  SHREK                          Thanks!                 Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.                                       FIONA                          (surprised)You didn\'t slay the dragon?                                                                  SHREK                          It\'s on my to-do list. Now come on!                           (takes off running and drags Fiona behind                           him.)                                        FIONA                          But this isn\'t right! You were meant                           to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.                           That\'s what all the other knights did.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, right before they burst into flame.                                                                  FIONA                          That\'s not the point. (Shrek suddenly                           stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek                           ignores her and heads for a wooden door                           off to the side.) Wait. Where are you                           going? The exit\'s over there.                                        SHREK                          Well, I have to save my ass.                                       FIONA                          What kind of knight are you?                                       SHREK                          One of a kind. (opens the door into                           the throne room)                                        DONKEY                          (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.                           I believe it\'s healthy to get to know                           someone over a long period of time.                           Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs                           worriedly) (we see him up close and                           from a distance as Shrek sneaks into                           the room) I don\'t want to rush into                           a physical relationship. I\'m not emotionally                           ready for a commitment of, uh, this                           - - Magnitude really is the word I\'m                           looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that                           is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what                           are you doing? Okay, okay. Let\'s just                           back up a little and take this one step                           at a time. We really should get to know                           each other first as friends or pen pals.                           I\'m on the road a lot, but I just love                           receiving cards - - I\'d really love                           to stay, but - - Don\'t do that! That\'s                           my tail! That\'s my personal tail. You\'re                           gonna tear it off. I don\'t give permission                           - - What are you gonna do with that?                           Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.                           No, no, no. No! Oh!                  Shrek grabs a chain that\'s connected to the chandelier and swings                 toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks                 up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.                 He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps                 Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.                 Instead the dragon kisses Shreks\' butt. She opens her eyes and                 roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto                 her head, but it\'s too big and it goes over her head and forms                 a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey                 take off running. Very \'Matrix\' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and                 then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.                                        DONKEY                          Hi, Princess!                                       FIONA                          It talks!                                       SHREK                          Yeah, it\'s getting him to shut up that\'s                           the trick.                  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots                 a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a                 crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His                 eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles                 off and walks lightly.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                 Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.                                                        SHREK                          Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I\'ll                           take care of the dragon.                  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the                 castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping                 chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that                 is still around the dragons neck.                                        SHREK                          (echoing) Run!                 They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot                 pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons                 breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on                 for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They                 are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look                 in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to                 get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the                 dragon back and she\'s unable to get to them. Our gang climbs                 quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a                 sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.                                        FIONA                          (sliding down the \'volcano\' hill) You                           did it! You rescued me! You\'re amazing.                           (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)                           You\'re - - You\'re wonderful. You\'re...                           (turns and sees Shrek fall down the                           hill and bump into Donkey) a little                           unorthodox I\'ll admit. But thy deed                           is great, and thy heart is pure. I am                           eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears                           his throat.) And where would a brave                           knight be without his noble steed?                                                                  DONKEY                          I hope you heard that. She called me                           a noble steed. She think I\'m a steed.                                                                  FIONA                          The battle is won. You may remove your                           helmet, good Sir Knight.                                        SHREK                          Uh, no.                                       FIONA                          Why not?                                       SHREK                          I have helmet hair.                                       FIONA                          Please. I would\'st look upon the face                           of my rescuer.                                        SHREK                          No, no, you wouldn\'t - - \'st.                                       FIONA                          But how will you kiss me?                                       SHREK                          What? (to Donkey) That wasn\'t in the                           job description.                                        DONKEY                          Maybe it\'s a perk.                                       FIONA                          No, it\'s destiny. Oh, you must know                           how it goes. A princess locked in a                           tower and beset by a dragon is rescued                           by a brave knight, and then they share                           true love\'s first kiss.                                        DONKEY                          Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.                           Wait. You think that Shrek is you true                           love?                                        FIONA                          Well, yes.                 Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.                                       DONKEY                          You think Shrek is your true love!                                                                  FIONA                          What is so funny?                                       SHREK                          Let\'s just say I\'m not your type, okay?Fiona:                           Of course, you are. You\'re my rescuer.                           Now - - Now remove your helmet.                                        SHREK                          Look. I really don\'t think this is a                           good idea.                                        FIONA                          Just take off the helmet.                                       SHREK                          I\'m not going to.                                       FIONA                          Take it off.                                       SHREK                          No!                                       FIONA                          Now!                                       SHREK                          Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.                           (takes off his helmet)                                        FIONA                          You- - You\'re a- - an ogre.                                       SHREK                          Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.                                                                  FIONA                          Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is                           all wrong. You\'re not supposed to be                           an ogre.                                        SHREK                          Princess, I was sent to rescue you by                           Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who                           wants to marry you.                                        FIONA                          Then why didn\'t he come rescue me?                                                                  SHREK                          Good question. You should ask him that                           when we get there.                                        FIONA                          But I have to be rescued by my true                           love, not by some ogre and his- - his                           pet.                                        DONKEY                          Well, so much for noble steed.                                       SHREK                          You\'re not making my job any easier.                                                                  FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but your job is not my problem.                           You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he                           wants to rescue me properly, I\'ll be                           waiting for him right here.                                        SHREK                          Hey! I\'m no one\'s messenger boy, all                           right? (ominous) I\'m a delivery boy.                           (he swiftly picks her up and swings                           her over his shoulder like she was a                           sack of potatoes)                                        FIONA                          You wouldn\'t dare. Put me down!                                       SHREK                          Ya comin\', Donkey?                                       DONKEY                          I\'m right behind ya.                                       FIONA                          Put me down, or you will suffer the                           consequences! This is not dignified!                           Put me down!                  WOODS                 A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just                 hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, so here\'s another question. Say                           there\'s a woman that digs you, right,                           but you don\'t really like her that way.                           How do you let her down real easy so                           her feelings aren\'t hurt, but you don\'t                           get burned to a crisp and eaten?                                        FIONA                          You just tell her she\'s not your true                           love. Everyone knows what happens when                           you find your...(Shrek drops her on                           the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to                           DuLoc the better.                                        DONKEY                          You\'re gonna love it there, Princess.                           It\'s beautiful!                                        FIONA                          And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?                           What\'s he like?                                        SHREK                          Let me put it this way, Princess. Men                           of Farquaad\'s stature are in short supply.                           (he and Donkey laugh)                  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off                 the dust and grime.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t know. There are those who think                           little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:                           Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You\'re                           just jealous you can never measure up                           to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, well, maybe you\'re right, Princess.                           But I\'ll let you do the ""measuring""                           when you see him tomorrow.                                        FIONA                          (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?                           It\'ll take that long? Shouldn\'t we stop                           to make camp?                                        SHREK                          No, that\'ll take longer. We can keep                           going.                                        FIONA                          But there\'s robbers in the woods.                                       DONKEY                          Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting                           to sound good.                                        SHREK                          Hey, come on. I\'m scarier than anything                           we\'re going to see in this forest.                                                                  FIONA                          I need to find somewhere to camp now!                                            Both Donkey and Shrek\'s ears lower as they shrink away from her.                                  MOUNTAIN CLIFF                 Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves                 a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.                                        SHREK                          Hey! Over here.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, we can do better than that. I                           don\'t think this is fit for a princess.                                                                  FIONA                          No, no, it\'s perfect. It just needs                           a few homey touches.                                        SHREK                          Homey touches? Like what? (he hears                           a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona                           who has torn the bark off of a tree.)                                                                  FIONA                          A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee                           good night. (goes into the cave and                           puts the bark door up behind her)                                                                  DONKEY                          You want me to read you a bedtime story?                           I will.                                        FIONA                          (os) I said good night!                 Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the                 boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona                 still inside.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, What are you doing?                                       SHREK                          (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,                           come on. I was just kidding.                  LATER THAT NIGHT                 Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring                 up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations                 to Donkey.                                        SHREK                          And, uh, that one, that\'s Throwback,                           the only ogre to ever spit over three                           wheat fields.                                        DONKEY                          Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future                           from these stars?                                        SHREK                          The stars don\'t tell the future, Donkey.                           They tell stories. Look, there\'s Bloodnut,                           the Flatulent. You can guess what he\'s                           famous for.                                        DONKEY                          I know you\'re making this up.                                       SHREK                          No, look. There he is, and there\'s the                           group of hunters running away from his                           stench.                                        DONKEY                          That ain\'t nothin\' but a bunch of little                           dots.                                        SHREK                          You know, Donkey, sometimes things are                           more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.                                                                  DONKEY                          (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what                           we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?                                                                  SHREK                          Our swamp?                                       DONKEY                          You know, when we\'re through rescuing                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          We? Donkey, there\'s no ""we"". There\'s                           no ""our"". There\'s just me and my swamp.                           The first thing I\'m gonna do is build                           a ten-foot wall around my land.                                        DONKEY                          You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real                           deep just now. You know what I think?                           I think this whole wall thing is just                           a way to keep somebody out.                                        SHREK                          No, do ya think?                                       DONKEY                          Are you hidin\' something?                                       SHREK                          Never mind, Donkey.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, this is another one of those onion                           things, isn\'t it?                                        SHREK                          No, this is one of those drop-it and                           leave-it alone things.                                        DONKEY                          Why don\'t you want to talk about it?                                                                  SHREK                          Why do you want to talk about it?                                       DONKEY                          Why are you blocking?                                       SHREK                          I\'m not blocking.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yes, you are.                                       SHREK                          Donkey, I\'m warning you.                                       DONKEY                          Who you trying to keep out?                                       SHREK                          Everyone! Okay?                                       DONKEY                          (pause) Oh, now we\'re gettin\' somewhere.                           (grins)                  At this point Fiona pulls the \'door\' away from the entrance to                 the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.                                        SHREK                          Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and                           walks over to the edge of the cliff                           and sits down)                                        DONKEY                          What\'s your problem? What you got against                           the whole world anyway?                                        SHREK                          Look, I\'m not the one with the problem,                           okay? It\'s the world that seems to have                           a problem with me. People take one look                           at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big,                           stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before                           they even know me. That\'s why I\'m better                           off alone.                                        DONKEY                          You know what? When we met, I didn\'t                           think you was just a big, stupid, ugly                           ogre.                                        SHREK                          Yeah, I know.                                       DONKEY                          So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?                                                                  SHREK                          Well, there\'s, um, Gabby, the Small                           and Annoying.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny                           one, right there. That one there?                                            Fiona puts the door back.                                       SHREK                          That\'s the moon.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, okay.                 DuLoc - Farquaad\'s Bedroom                 The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays                 in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic                 Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,                           show her to me. Show me the princess.                                                                  MIRROR                          Hmph.                 The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Ah. Perfect.                 Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up                 to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly                 at her image in the mirror.                  MORNING                 Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey                 who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes                 across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along                 with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles                 to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too                 big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but                 she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona                 is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still                 sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey\'s talking                 in his sleep.                                        DONKEY                          (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like                           it like that. Come on, baby. I said                           I like it.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)                                       DONKEY                          Huh? What?                                       SHREK                          Wake up.                                       DONKEY                          What? (stretches and yawns)                                       FIONA                          Good morning. Hm, how do you like your                           eggs?                                        DONKEY                          Oh, good morning, Princess!                 Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.                                       SHREK                          What\'s all this about?                                       FIONA                          You know, we kind of got off to a bad                           start yesterday. I wanted to make it                           up to you. I mean, after all, you did                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Uh, thanks.                 Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.                                       FIONA                          Well, eat up. We\'ve got a big day ahead                           of us. (walks off)                  LATER                 They are once again on their way. They are walking through the                 forest. Shrek belches.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek!                                       SHREK                          What? It\'s a compliment. Better out                           than in, I always say. (laughs)                                        DONKEY                          Well, it\'s no way to behave in front                           of a princess.                  Fiona belches                                       FIONA                          Thanks.                                       DONKEY                          She\'s as nasty as you are.                                       SHREK                          (chuckles) You know, you\'re not exactly                           what I expected.                                        FIONA                          Well, maybe you shouldn\'t judge people                           before you get to know them.                  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly                 from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into                 a tree.                                        ROBIN HOOD                          La liberte! Hey!                                       SHREK                          Princess!                                       FIONA                          (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!                           And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses                           up her arm while Fiona pulls back in                           disgust)...beast.                                        SHREK                          Hey! That\'s my princess! Go find you                           own!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Please, monster! Can\'t you see I\'m a                           little busy here?                                        FIONA                          (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don\'t                           know who you think you are!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please                           let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.                           (laughs)                  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out                 from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin\'s theme song.                                        MERRY MEN                          Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          I steal from the rich and give to the                           needy.                                        MERRY MEN                          He takes a wee percentage,                                       ROBIN HOOD                          But I\'m not greedy. I rescue pretty                           damsels, man, I\'m good.                                        MERRY MEN                          What a guy, Monsieur Hood.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          Break it down. I like an honest fight                           and a saucy little maid...                                        MERRY MEN                          What he\'s basically saying is he likes                           to get...                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush                           grabs a lady by the tush. That\'s bad.                                                                  MERRY MEN                          That\'s bad.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          When a beauty\'s with a beast it makes                           me awfully mad.                                        MERRY MEN                          He\'s mad, he\'s really, really mad.                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          I\'ll take my blade and ram it through                           your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys                           \'cause I\'m about to start...                  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and                 knocks Robin Hood unconscious.                                        FIONA                          Man, that was annoying!                 Shrek looks at her in admiration.                                       MERRY MAN                          Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at                           Fiona but she ducks out of the way)                                            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek\'s arms to                 get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.                                  Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and                 then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is                 a very interesting \'Matrix\' moment here when Fiona pauses in                 mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,                 and Fiona begins walking away.                                        FIONA                          Uh, shall we?                                       SHREK                          Hold the phone.

Where did that come                           from?                                        FIONA                          What?

Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue                 on their way.                  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.                 Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a                 small brook so that Fiona won\'t get wet. Shrek then gets up as                 Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back                 into it\'s upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting                 and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb                 that\'s on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it                 around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins                 eating like it\'s a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.                 Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting                 it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning                 it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek.

I used to                           be afraid of the dark, too, until -                           - Hey, no, wait. I\'m still afraid of                           the dark.                  Shrek sighs                                       FIONA                          Good night.                                       SHREK                          Good night.                 Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks                 at Shrek with a new eye.                                        DONKEY                          Ohh!

SHREK                          Yeah. An ogre.                                       DONKEY                          Hey, where you goin\'?                                       SHREK                          To get... move firewood. (sighs)                 Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already                 is.                  TIME LAPSE                 Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is                 nowhere to be seen.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,                           where are you? Princess?                  Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can\'t see her.                                                        DONKEY                          It\'s very spooky in here. I ain\'t playing                           no games.                  Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn\'t                 look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking                 out.                                        DONKEY                          Aah!

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets                 down.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? What happened to you?

OUTSIDE                 Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his                 hand.

He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey                 and Fiona talking.

That\'s why I can\'t                           stay here with Shrek.                  Shrek steps back in shock.

He throws the flower down and walks                 away.                  INSIDE                                       FIONA                          Don\'t you see, Donkey?

DONKEY                          What\'s the point of being able to talk                           if you gotta keep secrets?

Look at my eye twitchin\'.                  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks                 down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back                 inside the windmill.                  MORNING                 Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still                 awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.                                        FIONA                          I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,                           I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly                           runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!                           Shrek, there\'s something I want...(she                           looks and sees the rising sun, and as                           the sun crests the sky she turns back                           into a human.)                  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards                 her.                                        FIONA                          Shrek. Are you all right?                                       SHREK                          Perfect! Never been better.                                       FIONA                          I - - I don\'t - - There\'s something                           I have to tell you.                                        SHREK                          You don\'t have to tell me anything,                           Princess. I heard enough last night.                                                                  FIONA                          You heard what I said?                                       SHREK                          Every word.                                       FIONA                          I thought you\'d understand.                                       SHREK                          Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who                           could love a hideous, ugly beast?""                                                                  FIONA                          But I thought that wouldn\'t matter to                           you.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at                           him in shock. He looks past her and                           spots a group approaching.) Ah, right                           on time. Princess, I\'ve brought you                           a little something.                  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal                 sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he\'s only                 like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers                 march by.                                        DONKEY                          What\'d I miss? What\'d I miss? (spots                           the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?                           Couldn\'t have been the donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona.                                       SHREK                          As promised. Now hand it over.                                       FARQUAAD                          Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece                           of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared                           out, as agreed. Take it and go before                           I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)                           Forgive me, Princess, for startling                           you, but you startled me, for I have                           never seen such a radiant beauty before.                           I\'m Lord Farquaad.                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad                           snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,                           for I was just saying a short... (Watches                           as Farquaad is lifted off his horse                           and set down in front of her. He comes                           to her waist.) farewell.                                        FARQUAAD                          Oh, that is so sweet. You don\'t have                           to waste good manners on the ogre. It\'s                           not like it has feelings.                                        FIONA                          No, you\'re right. It doesn\'t.                 Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless                           Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.                           Will you be the perfect bride for the                           perfect groom?                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would                           make - -                                        FARQUAAD                          (interrupting) Excellent! I\'ll start                           the plans, for tomorrow we wed!                                        FIONA                          No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let\'s get                           married today before the sun sets.                                                                  FARQUAAD                          Oh, anxious, are you? You\'re right.                           The sooner, the better. There\'s so much                           to do! There\'s the caterer, the cake,                           the band, the guest list. Captain, round                           up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona                           on the back of his horse)                                        FIONA                          Fare-thee-well, ogre.                 Farquaad\'s whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches                 them go.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, what are you doing? You\'re letting                           her get away.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? So what?                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, there\'s something about her you                           don\'t know. Look, I talked to her last                           night, She\'s - -                                        SHREK                          I know you talked to her last night.                           You\'re great pals, aren\'t ya? Now, if                           you two are such good friends, why don\'t                           you follow her home?

Fiona                 being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running                 into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner                 alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.                  SHREK\'S HOME                 Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes                 outside to investigate.                                        SHREK                          Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues                           with what he\'s doing.) What are you                           doing?                                        DONKEY                          I would think, of all people, you would                           recognize a wall when you see one.                                                                  SHREK                          Well, yeah. But the wall\'s supposed                           to go around my swamp, not through it.

I get half the                           booty. Now hand me that big old rock,                           the one that looks like your head.

(whistles)                  Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so                 they can climb on.

DULOC - CHURCH                 Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there.                 The prompter card guy holds up a card that says \'Revered Silence\'.

COURTYARD                 Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with                 a boom. The guards all take off running.                                        DONKEY                          (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN.                           If we need you, I\'ll whistle. How about                           that?

Fiona,                           my love, we\'re but a kiss away from                           our ""happily ever after."" Now kiss me!

FIONA                          (looking at the setting sun) ""By night                           one way, by day another."" (to Shrek)                           I wanted to show you before.                  She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self.                 She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.                                        SHREK                          Well, uh, that explains a lot.

I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon                           show up and the dragon leans down and                           eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!                                        DONKEY                          All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon                           here, and I\'m not afraid to use it.                           (The dragon roars.) I\'m a donkey on                           the edge!                  The dragon belches and Farquaad\'s crown flies out of her mouth                 and falls to the ground.                                        DONKEY                          Celebrity marriages. They never last,                           do they?                  The congregation cheers.                                       DONKEY                          Go ahead, Shrek.                                       SHREK                          Uh, Fiona?                                       FIONA                          Yes, Shrek?                                       SHREK                          I - - I love you.                                       FIONA                          Really?                                       SHREK                          Really, really.                                       FIONA                          (smiles) I love you too.                 Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes                 \'Awwww\' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.                                                        CONGREGATION                          Aawww!                 Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She\'s lifted                 up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around                 her.                                        WHISPERS                          ""Until you find true love\'s first kiss                           and then take love\'s true form. Take                           love\'s true form. Take love\'s true form.""                                            Suddenly Fiona\'s eyes open wide. She\'s consumed by the spell                 and then is slowly lowered to the ground.                                        SHREK                          (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are                           you all right?                                        FIONA                          (standing up, she\'s still an ogre) Well,                           yes. But I don\'t understand. I\'m supposed                           to be beautiful.                                        SHREK                          But you ARE beautiful.                 They smile at each other.                                       DONKEY                          (chuckles) I was hoping this would be                           a happy ending.                  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...                 THE SWAMP                 ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. \'I\'m                 a Believer\' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek                 and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting                 carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet                 which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end                 up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet                 instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now                 has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona                 walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over                 singing the song.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          God bless us, every one.                                       DONKEY                          (as he\'s done singing and we fade to                           black) Oh, that\'s funny. Oh. Oh. I can\'t                           breathe. I can\'t breathe.                  THE END",,6

This system's goal is to use real-time control systems and embedded microcontrollers to balance a ball on a flat plate. The project was proposed and implemented as part of the SFU class: Real-Time and Embedded Control Systems - MSE 450.  The project used PID feedback controllers to control the pitch and roll of the platform to provide control of the ball's position. A resistive touch screen was used for position feedback and two low-cost hobby servos were used for platform actuation. The controller was implemented in C on a Texas Instruments Tiva C microcontroller (EK-TM4C123GXL). The mechanical structure was designed using SolidWorks and 3D printed on an inexpensive Prusa i3 clone.""}",,4

The idea is to do the same thing, but with more impact in a personal space. The site is poised to be somewhat of a Facebook LinkedIn hybrid. The site is primarily focused to be a company internal CRM (customer relationship management) system; I call it an Employee Community Network (ECN). From the site, you can connect with other company employees, post about your interests, showcase your talents, and even see what internal jobs are open within the company with our ECN job board. The site showcases the hobbies and passions of employees throughout the organization and allows co-workers to find fellow employees that share similar interests. Not only does this bring the entire company closer together, it also opens up possibilities for better collaboration at work as workers begin to build report with one another across the organization and building close ties.

0,https://github.com/Randheer1184165/social_media.git,"StuffDOT” is a web based project meant to design a web site that will allow users to post the things they shop, share and earn rewards for their recommendations and online purchases. Social media are computer-mediated tools that allow people to create, share or exchange information, career interests, ideas, and pictures/videos in virtual communities and networks. Social media is defined as ""a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content."" Furthermore, social media depends on mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content. They introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between businesses, organizations, communities, and individuals. While social sharing allows users to share there online purchases.  StuffDOT is meant to share, shop and find deals all in one place. Admin share the money generated by the user’s online activity among the users. User post the things they like as user would with any other site. When any of their friend purchases an item through their post, user earns rewards. User may turn their rewards into gift cards from any of their favorite stores with the click of a button.  Social media and social sharing website project itself is a huge project comprising various features like profile updating, friend’s list organization, online shopping, earning rewards and various other application to enhance the overall look and feel of the website. However, in this project we are basically working on two essential feature or module (PROFILE MANAGEMENT & ONLINE SHOPPING). PROFILE MANAGEMENT module maintain the profile of a user like name, like, dislikes, hobbies, status etc. including friends organization module maintains the friend list, handles request and sends request to the other user. While online shopping allows user to shop from various online shopping sites and share.    Profiles and Shopping are two key features on social media and social sharing site. The third is a public commenting feature (‘Comments’, ‘Like’, ‘Share’etc). This feature allows individuals to comment on their Friend’s profiles share their online shopping experience with their friends. These comments are displayed prominently and visible for anyone who has access to that profile. Also on sharing their online shopping experience user gets rewards. ",,2

It will probably work with the Dragon Data Dragon computers as well. It uses a 27C512 EPROM jumper selected as two 32K banks. The CoCo 1, 2 and Dragon can only access the first 16K of each bank. The CoCo 3 can access the entire 32K of each bank, minus the 0xFFnn I/O and Vector page.

0,https://github.com/DaccioZilla/Tributa-es-por-NCM.git,"Eusou contador, mas sou entusiasta de programação, em especial em temas relacionados com Data Science. Inclusive, minha opinião pessoal é que contabilidade e ciência de dados tem tudo a ver (mais sobre isso no futuro). Hoje, a ideia é abordar um tema mais “clássico” da contabilidade, a saber, a questão tributária. Para simplificar muito, com o perdão de qualquer estudioso da incrível complexidade do nosso sistema de impostos, as alíquotas que incidem sobre qualquer mercadoria ou produto no Brasil podem ser resumidas em um único parâmetro: a NCM. Aí, você, querido leitor pode estar se perguntando “que diabos é um NCM? Onde vivem: O que comem?”. Pois bem, NCM é a sigla para Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul, que é basicamente um tabelão para padronizar a nomenclatura de produtos. Assim, você pode utilizar um 9609.10.00 para desenhar em seu 4820.20.00. Tudo o que circula no país está devidamente codificado pela NCM, você pode conferir na nota fiscal, logo depois da descrição do produto. Voltando aos tributos, os fiscos federal e estaduais, em suas legislações, utilizam a classificação da NCM para a a indicação dos tributos. Então, para saber a alíquota de IPI, Pis, Cofins, Icms ou Icms-ST, ou mesmo se existem condições especiais como redução de base de calculo ou isenções, você procura as NCMs nos diversos regulamentos de impostos. Parametrizar as configurações tributárias em sistemas integrados de gestão é basicamente vincular as alíquotas a uma NCM, uma UF de Origem e uma UF de Destino (e meu amigo, isso dá trabalho…). Então, nesse hobby de brincar com dados, pensei em qual seria a dificuldade de constituir essa base de dados, em relacionar todos as alíquotas, isenções e benefícios fiscais em uma única base de dados, usando a NCM como chave. Para não pegar pesado logo de cara, escolhi o IPI, que é tributo federal então eu só precisaria começar com uma fonte de dados: A Receita Federal (para o ICMS teríamos que raspar pelo menos 27 fontes diferentes). Eu esperava encontrar um arquivo CSV mas… o que tinha era PDF. Ocorre que PDF é uma formato pensado para a visualização estática de documentos, e não para a distribuição de dados. Já tentou fazer PROCV ou um CORRESP num arquivo PDF? Pois é… não dá… Como nessa quarentena de COVID-19 a gente tá com tédio e tempo de sobra, resolvi abrir uma série qui no Medium para documentar essa jornada de tentar criar um repositório em que se consiga todos os parâmetros tributários de um tributo simplesmente indicando o NCM. E também é um jeito de eu estudar Python. Por enquanto é isso. Valeu!",,2
