We are proposing a system that employs robotics manipulators (UR5 industrial arm equipped with a gripper in our experiments) to stack objects with arbitrary shapes to construct a rigid wall. Some of the challenges in this problem are:    1) Planning the optimal stacking order and relative placing of the objects   2) Reliable grasping and transporting of arbitrarily shaped objects   3) Accurate detection and localization of the arm and the objects  The system is being implemented over ROS to connect to and control the UR5 arm, and MoveIt package is employed to perform collision aware trajectory planning for the manipulator/grasper set. A variety of objects with different shapes and features, e.g. deformability, are considered for the experiments. ",,6

In order to help scientists understand earthquakes better, an international monitoring system is in place to record where earthquakes occur and how powerful they are. Earthquake strength is measured by the ‘magnitude moment’: earthquakes of magnitude three or lower usually imperceptible but those with magnitude seven and over can cause serious damage over large areas. National seismological observatories record earthquakes that occur, although different observatories were set up at different times, so the period over which historical data is available varies from place to place.",,1
