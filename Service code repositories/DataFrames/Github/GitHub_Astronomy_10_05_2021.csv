280,https://github.com/anupammr89/matrix.git,"MATRIX is a distributed data-aware execution fabric supporting both high-performance computing (HPC) and many-task computing (MTC) workloads. The execution fabric is fault tolerant by having all compute nodes participate in the job submission and handling process; work stealing is used to achieve efficient distributed load balancing. The fabric guarantees job execution and dependencies, and relies on an underlying scalable distributed storage system for inter-process communication (e.g. FusionFS). Data-aware scheduling maximizes data locality by scheduling computational tasks close to the data. Computations are overlapped with I/O to reduce wasted resources and hide latencies. The fabric is elastic, allowing it to grow and shrink in resource usage based on the application demand. The fabric also support compact task representation to alleviate task submission bottlenecks for common patterns (e.g. ‚Äúfor each x do y‚Äù). The execution fabric is integrated with several other projects, including FusionFS(a distributed file system), D^3 (direct distributed data-structure), and Swift (parallel programming system). The work will be evaluated with many applications (e.g. bioinformatics, medicine, pharmaceuticals, astronomy, physics, climate modeling, economics, and analytics) through the Swift project collaboration on the largest high-end computing (HEC) systems.",,4
281,https://github.com/jonwihl/FATS-2.0.git,"In time-domain astronomy, data gathered from the telescopes is usually represented in the form of light-curves. These are time series that show the brightness variation of an object through a period of time (for a visual representation see video below). Based on the variability characteristics of the light-curves, celestial objects can be classified into different groups (quasars, long period variables, eclipsing binaries, etc.) and consequently be studied in depth independently.  In order to characterize this variability, some of the existing methods use machine learning algorithms that build their decision on the light-curves features. Features, the topic of the following work, are numerical descriptors that aim to characterize and distinguish the different variability classes. They can go from basic statistical measures such as the mean or the standard deviation, to complex time-series characteristics such as the autocorrelation function.  In this document we present a library with a compilation of some of the existing light-curve features. The main goal is to create a collaborative and open tool where every user can characterize or analyze an astronomical photometric database while also contributing to the library by adding new features. However, it is important to highlight that this library is not restricted to the astronomical field and could also be applied to any kind of time series.  Our vision is to be capable of analyzing and comparing light-curves from all the available astronomical catalogs in a standard and universal way. This would facilitate and make more efficient tasks as modeling, classification, data cleaning, outlier detection and data analysis in general. Consequently, when studying light-curves, astronomers and data analysts would be on the same wavelength and would not have the necessity to find a way of comparing or matching different features. In order to achieve this goal, the library should be run in every existent survey (MACHO, EROS, OGLE, Catalina, Pan-STARRS, etc) and future surveys (LSST) and the results should be ideally shared in the same open way as this library.",,4

There have been considerable improvements over the past decades in the detection of exoplanets. NASA launched the Kepler satellite in 2009 with the mission to hunt exoplanets. The data gathered by the satellite have been made publicly available by NASA in an attempt to increase development in the field of astroinformatics, a crossdisciplinary field consisting of astronomy, data science and informatics. This has led to increased contribution in detecting exoplanets among non-exoplanets. In this paper, we explore various techniques to detect exoplanets using the intensity of light captured by Kepler space telescope. The dimming in flux (light intensity) of the stars indicates an orbiting body around that star. We perform preliminary analysis and prepare the data to be fed in to our data mining models. We have used multiple models to efficiently classify the exoplanets. The first model, H2O‚Äôs Deep Learning, is based on a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network. We have then performed the Gradient Boosting technique using XGBoost algorithm, an ensemble technique that works on the concept of Decision Tree and Bootstrap Aggregation. Finally, we have used Convolutional Neural Network, a Black Box method, to classify the exoplanets. This paper will provide the results, model performance and efficiency of the various algorithms used to detect such exoplanets. ",,1
929,https://github.com/aliaryan/satellite-orbit-prediction.git,"Predicting the position of satellites is one of the big challenges in astronomy. More than 500,000 pieces of debris are tracked as they orbit the Earth. They all travel at speeds up to 28163.52 km/hour, fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite. If space debris hits the satellite it would result in the creation of more debris. According to NASA, there are more than 3,000 satellites currently revolving around the earth‚Äôs orbit. If most of these satellites are damaged as a result of space junk, it will result in the creation of more space debris that will lead to Kessler syndrome. The existing SGP4-simulator in the satellite predicts the position of the satellite before but it‚Äôs an approximation. The solution can be to create a machine learning model that learns from the historical publicly available data that contains simulated coordinate data and the true coordinate data and predicts the value which has less error as compared to SGP4-simulator. We will be using gradient boosting in this project. The machine learning model will lie somewhere in between the simulated value and the true value and thus will be suited well enough to improve the existing model. The accuracy of the existing model will be increased.",,1
930,https://github.com/lucaambrosio/TSP.git,"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: ""Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?"" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.  The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.  In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where, given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has any tour shorter than L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.  The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, a large number of heuristics and exact algorithms are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.[1]  The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources will want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.",,1
