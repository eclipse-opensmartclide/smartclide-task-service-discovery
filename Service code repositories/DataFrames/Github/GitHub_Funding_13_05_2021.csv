However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

Kick Starter Coins: Below is a list of coins that will be included during the initial phase of this project.  Listed coins will stake on behalf of SaluS project, stakes will be sold on exchanges to increase BTC reserve.   Cloud Staking Service: Fees will be 5% of the stakes, however, the advantages listed below easily outweigh the fees.  1) Experience, keen knowledge of Coin specs. 2) Customized wallets for optimum stacking 3) Staking Advantage, (whaling weight/diff), Research for Optimum block size. 4) 24/7 Uptime, No Hassle, no worry, No Resource staking.  Affiliate programs: All profit made from affiliate programs will go to SaluS reserve to increase NAV.  If you hold Salus coin and would like to help your investment grow, sign up for the services listed below using provided links.  Foundation Transaction Fee - .0001 This is a separate TX fee of .0001 that goes to a specific Address, called the Foundation Transaction fee. This fee is in place for couple of reasons. 1) To control inflation since the supply is set to increase by 1% annually. 2) Resold to increase the reserve.  Mining Guaranteed Minimum CPU hash rate of 1000H/s   Would encourage everyone invested in this coin with CPU power to spare, to click on the link below. link will be up soon.  Traders Advantage: Top 10 Claimed Addresses on the rich list will have access to all trades and portfolio activity/status in near real time. There will be a fee for those who are not on top 10 list but would like to have access to such information. All fees will be added to the reserve fund.  MultiPool: http://hashgoal.com/  ""Holy Grail"" - Financial Instrument Will not disclose any information about this project at this time, but I do believe this will take SaluS to a whole new level if it gets off the ground.   (details on this project will be announced as soon as development officially starts) ",,6

0,https://github.com/SullyVo/Lendingclub-loan.git,"1 Introduction LendingClub is a peer to peer lending company in which their product allows consumers to both invest and borrow loans. They offer multiple kinds of loans like student loans, personal loans, auto refinancing loans and even business loans. The borrowers who are interested in obtaining loans will get a loan grade assigned to them which affect their interest rates and the amount of money they can borrow. A lot of the LendingClub data leads to insightful conclusions about the borrowing and investing patterns of all kinds of individuals. Through our investigation, we will explain patterns and similarities of the behaviors of borrowers and investors. 1.1 Questions of Interest We intend to start off with exploratory data analysis of all the factors involved to find patterns and relationships. We will look at the data from multiple angles to get a sense of the intricacies that lie within the data. We will additionally match the trend we see in the data to external events to try to explain why such is happening. We will also conduct time series decomposition in regards to the average loan amounts being requested. We will take a look at the trend and the seasonality so that we can better forecast spikes in demand. After, we will try to fit prediction models in order to answer a couple questions: namely whether a loan request from a client should be funded or not from the perspective of the bank, and what interest rate a borrower would get for a loan from the perspective of a client. After finding good models, we will deconstruct them in order to get a deeper sense of the important aspects in such decisions. 1.2 Dataset The dataset we are using is a compilation of data on loans issued by LendingClub from the period 2007 to 2015. The data includes information on the current loan status (how much has been funded so far, how much has been paid off, etc) as well as information about the borrower (occupation, income, credit score, etc). This data lends itself to a variety of interesting financial analysis, notably time series analysis since the data is date stamped. We will touch on a number of variables present in the dataset throughout the course of this analysis. We will consolidate the meanings of all these variables here for future reference. ‚Ä¢ loan_amnt: listed amount of the loan applied for by the borrower ‚Ä¢ funded_amnt: total amount committed to that loan at that point in time ‚Ä¢ funded_amnt_inv: total amount committed by investors for that loan at that point in time ‚Ä¢ term: number of payments on the loan. Values are in months and can be either 36 or 60 ‚Ä¢ int_rate: interest rate on the loan University of California, Davis ‚Ä¢ installment: monthly payment owed by the borrower ‚Ä¢ grade: loan grade that corresponds to the risk of the loan ‚Ä¢ loan_status: current status of the loan ‚Ä¢ total_bal_il: total current balance of all installment accounts ‚Ä¢ emp_title: job title of the borrower ‚Ä¢ next_pymnt_d: next scheduled payment date ‚Ä¢ sec_app_mort_acc: number of mortgage accounts at time of application for the secondary applicant More information about the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data",,5

AEON is for people who want to pay and live freely, who want to be part of the cryptocurrency revolution and want to try something new. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol and uses the CryptoNight-Lite[1] algorithm, and features: - True anonymity & data protection - Untraceable payments uses ring signature - Unlinkable transactions with random data by the sender - Blockchain analysis resistant - CPU/GPU mining, ASIC-resistant   Roadmap April 26, 2015 - new roadmap announced Mobile-friendly PoW and block time (released) GUI wallet (in progress) 32-bit and ARM support (released, but requires low memory footprint below) Low memory footprint (in progress) Signature trimming  Blockchain pruning (test release available) Multisig and payment channels (instant payments)   Development Team: Lead developer: smooth Release engineering, Q/A, support: Arux Other roles: open (PM smooth) Original developer (as Monero fork): anonymous   Bounties: None currently open.

Start mining from the wallet using start_mining command   Windows Compilation: (provided by community member cryptrol) Compile steps for Windows x64 using MSVC First of all let\'s get all the tools we need : - Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013 (It\'s a free version of visual studio with some license limitations).   You can uncheck the web development tools and SQL tools since you won\'t use them for building AEON.   This will take time to download and install and you will have to reboot upon completion. - Download and install cMake for windows from : http://www.cmake.org/download/ (Win32 install) - Download Boost 1.57 from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ , use the zip or 7zip archive and extract.   You can use c:\\boost_1_57_0 since this is what I am using for this steps. - Download and install Github for Windows from https://windows.github.com/ (This also includes a Git shell that we will use later).  Now the nasty part compile & build time ! - Build Boost :   Open a command line and type : Code:  > cd c:\\boost_1_57_0   > bootstrap.bat   > b2 --toolset=msvc variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static address-model=64 - Open the Git Shell (or Git bash) depending what you downloaded previously and do. Code:  > git clone https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.git   > cd aeon   > mkdir build   > cd build   > cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12 Win64"" -DBOOST_ROOT=c:\\boost_1_57_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=c:\\boost_1_57_0\\stage\\lib ..   > MSBuild Project.sln /p:Configuration=release /m    You should now find the exe files under build/src/release . Aeon isn\'t a cryptocurrency. It\'s a lifestyle. It\'s about polished perfection, attained by breaking the rules with calculated mastery of the art. It\'s about respecting history and pushing innovation forward at the same time. It\'s about more than just math: it\'s a vision of a world where luxury is the same as entry-level, and the limits are the heavens themselves. If you\'re just buying Aeon to get rich, don\'t even bother. Aeon needs more than just the next wave of crypto speculators: we\'re looking for the truly elite. But if you think you have what it takes to redefine global finance and discover new magnitudes of wealth in the process... Well, Aeon is ready for you. Are you ready for Aeon? ",,5

0,https://github.com/jstjyoti/Smart-India-Hackathon--team-DigIndia-.git,"{""Smart India Hackathon 2018  Identification of meritorious students in primary education  Problem Statement:-  Gujarat government has nearly 90 lac students studying in primary education across state. They are in different cities and villages across state. There is no mechanism to identify bright students who are performing well in study, sports or other activities. Web portal can be designed to acquire date about such students and can be analyzed on different parameters. What Exact Problem is being solved? : Such identified students can be provided with extra resources or special attention can be given to their upbringing.  Abstract  To identify meritorious students firstly all the educational institutions need to upload the results of students as well as points of extra curriculum activity (activity name, score out of 10 for performance) to the database for a student according to the current class of study. Aadhar number for all the students will always be given (from there students details will be verified).A parent or any other nongovernment institute can also upload scanned copy of result or certificate of any student with his/her Aadhar number and their own details. Admin will Cross-check and verify it for the update in the database. One‚Äôs (schools and institutions) first login or registration, there will be a unique token, (user id and password) to the Portal. That login will be further verified. So every institution will have a unique user id and password and students' details will be uploaded yearly and updates will be done twice in a year.  The second fold of the solution is to sort the data according to the merit of students. The designed application will perform the operation with the provided data and present a lesser (according to requirement) students' details. There should be some methods (a faster and optimal Algorithm to sort data by marks and activity score from database Base will be adopted i.e., any tree type-level representation) to sort the data (details) of meritorious students from provided records of all the students.  The third and final part is providing the list of meritorious students to the education department and university. Each official and university will also have a login section. The list of meritorious students will be provided according to year, required field. The education department or university can also post the facilities provided to the selected and shortlisted student as a notice.  Therefore, we are going to solve the stated problem by providing a Web-based application comprising of Web portal and secured database to identify meritorious students in primary education according to data (100%) uploaded and retrieved from several institutions and selected meritorious students list will be provided to (according to specification of different facilities 20-30%) to Education Department and Universities.  Keywords:  Aadhar Number as Primary key of Student Table. Online WEB-portal. Update Records every year to keep a check on the improvement, Standardization & Soring data based on Z ‚Äì stat to filter out the meritorious students on the basis of acads and extra-curricular activities. Tree type-level representation of Database i.e. Admin ‚Äì Institute ‚Äì Student. Use Case :- Choice Based selection of meritorious student from data set. For instances if the requirement is only limited to academics, they can refer to the website to fetch a list of top scorers say top 100 or top 200 students. Again if the requirement is limited to selection of Extra-curricular activity like ‚Äì singing, painting, dancing etc they can fetch the list of students having expertise in that particular field only. Identification of poor meritorious students and Funding based support from different NGO‚Äôs, organizations and donations if they want to provide. Supervising data based on entries done in every year (Region based) to keep a check on the individual growth of a student. For instances, a diligent student say X has been receiving scholarship every year now say that X student‚Äôs data has not been registered in Database in the next year. Thus there is a decay of GDP in the sample space. To highlight the social issues such as Child Labour, child trafficking, by year wise regulation Data. To prevent the girl child marriage on the basis of Dataset by the investigation Team. For instance if a girl found not registering in the consecutive Year, an investigation team can take action accordingly. Special Features: The school should submit their data to get a recognition as well as to be in sight of fund providing parties (governmental or non-governmental). Students will be benefited as direct communication is in between officials and student and no middle man in between. ‚Ä¢ Data analysis will be the key point to identification using assignment of z-marks by standard normal distribution. Technology Stack:  We are to make a Web-based app, in a microlithic structure format, where the app structure is broken into different fragments, which does the different job. One part will be taking in the to the database from a web portal designed using CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Servlet. Computation of the sorted data and the various mathematical calculations i.e. arranging the sorted data according to given criteria etc on a mathematical platform powered by JAVA. Another part will be integrated with the API's of various Education Department and Universities to provide them up with shortlisted meritorious students, integrating with their personal choices and cut-offs, and also where shortlisted students will be notified by notice posted. Keeping in mind the ease of obtaining marks and details which has increased throughout the years. In the web app, after one's first login or registration, each part of the education department, university and institution have a unique token, (user id and password) to the database. Coming to the part of its database, My SQL or Oracle or Mongo DB can be used with a firmed dashboard powered by python or JavaScript on a network frame. Since the app will be containing huge academic details of many students, so a strong encryption algorithm is to be used for data integrity and data security. AES-256 or MD5 would be best to use to protect the data in the database and for authentication Biometric data will also be preserved.""}",,4

0,https://github.com/NamanBardiya/APPLICATION-OF-CHIT-FUND-SYSTEM-WITH-CRYPTO-PAYMENTS.git,"OBJECTIVES:-  Our idea focuses on building a cryptocurrency for P&G, say P&G coin which would be used for cashless transaction and using them for chit fund system in order to popularize crypto payments among suppliers and retailers. This P&G coin will be the use case of block chain. Hence it would be more secure compared to other cashless payment methods. Value of each coin could be decided by company as per their profits or any other criteria.  HOW CHIT FUND SYSTEM WORKS:-  Supplier and retailer will have a choice whether they want to be a part of the chit fund system. Each subscriber in the chit fund would be asked to keep a bid, say one P&G coin, suppose there are 50 subscribers in this chain, so the total bid amount would be 50 P&G coins. A lucky name would be picked up and 45 P&G coins will be served in the account of that lucky supplier or retailer. Rest 5 coins would be distributed among rest of the members. This withdrawal of lucky names would be done monthly and will continue for 50 months, as there are 50 subscribers, every member will get a chance to win the fund. Once a particular subscriber wins, we can decrease his probability to win next time, so that everybody gets a chance to win. Actual chit fund system works with a little difference in India. It was given below in the uploaded images. Chit fund system can bring many suppliers and retailers who believes cash payments as more secure way of transaction to crypto payment methods. Hence cashless economy of P&G would increase with more secure way of transaction i.e by using P&G coin Block chain.  POST CAMPAIGN WORK:-  Our idea of collaborating chit funds with block chain may or may not be selected for this innovation challenge , but we are and we will continue working on it because we believe it is not about winning or loosing in the challenge but its about what practical knowledge we gain and implement by putting all our interest in these miraculous field called block chain Technology.",,2

Following that declaration, since the beginning of 21st century, policy debate on food vs. fuel has raised public demonstration throughout the world, particularly in Brazil, US and Europe due to the dilemma regarding farmland use changes by rising biofuel production which reinforce negatively the food supply. That worldwide concern regarding Water-Energy-Food nexus has led controversy within the existing international and regional legal systems such as policy harmonization debates between EU and her member states regarding water, food and energy domains even though food as a sub-domain of common agricultural policy was predominately a common concern at the EU level since its origin. Concurrently, in 2010, UN Resolution 64/292 explicitly recognized human right to clean drinking water and German Federal Government initiated, for the first time as such, an on-line resource platform for Water-Energy-Food Security nexus funded by EU and in partnership with World Economic Forum, WEF and IFPRI. Subsequently Bonn Conference 2011 on ‚ÄòThe water Energy Food Security Nexus ‚Äì Solutions for the Green Economy‚Äô recognized the nexus perspective and provided the guiding principles for the nexus which drawn outstanding policy discourse in the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio 2012. Consecutively, in 2012, US National Intelligence Council published their report on ‚ÄòGlobal Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds‚Äô, where the nexus is declared as the fourth out of five most emerging global trends. Since then, subsequently, many governments like US, Germany, Brazil etc. as well as regional and international organizations like EU, UNWater and OECD have started policy discourse on how to recognize nexus and manage nexus resources using innovation and technology while there is no legal definition of such nexus. Very recently, on 25 September 2015, UN Resolution 70/1 on ‚ÄòTransforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development‚Äô declared 17 sustainable development goals where goal 2, 6, and 7 deals with food, water and energy security respectively. In addition, paragraph 16 of the said Resolution explicitly specified the need to bridge digital divide and to develop knowledge society using ICT as a means. This utterance of the said UN Resolution is coherent with the EU Decision 456/2005/EC which clearly emphasised to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable.

Christof Koch doubts the possibility of ""intelligent"" machines attaining consciousness, because ""[e]ven the most sophisticated brain simulations are unlikely to produce conscious feelings."" (p. 48.) According to Koch, ""Whether machines can become sentient [is important] for ethical reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers\' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible ‚Äì the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation. The alternative, embodied by IIT [Integrated Information Theory], is that computers will remain only supersophisticated machinery, ghostlike empty shells, devoid of what we value most: the feeling of life itself."" (p. 49.) Marcus, Gary, ""Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind"", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58‚Äì63. A stumbling block to AI has been an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. An example is the ""pronoun disambiguation problem"": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence refers. (p. 61.) E McGaughey, \'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away?

0,https://github.com/rpadma/Rappay.git,"{""My entry for ICICI Bank Hackathon 2016- Proposed a mobile app with the following functionality     1)      A bank account is at the crux of a user‚Äôs relationship with the bank. However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

Kick Starter Coins: Below is a list of coins that will be included during the initial phase of this project.  Listed coins will stake on behalf of SaluS project, stakes will be sold on exchanges to increase BTC reserve.   Cloud Staking Service: Fees will be 5% of the stakes, however, the advantages listed below easily outweigh the fees.  1) Experience, keen knowledge of Coin specs. 2) Customized wallets for optimum stacking 3) Staking Advantage, (whaling weight/diff), Research for Optimum block size. 4) 24/7 Uptime, No Hassle, no worry, No Resource staking.  Affiliate programs: All profit made from affiliate programs will go to SaluS reserve to increase NAV.  If you hold Salus coin and would like to help your investment grow, sign up for the services listed below using provided links.  Foundation Transaction Fee - .0001 This is a separate TX fee of .0001 that goes to a specific Address, called the Foundation Transaction fee. This fee is in place for couple of reasons. 1) To control inflation since the supply is set to increase by 1% annually. 2) Resold to increase the reserve.  Mining Guaranteed Minimum CPU hash rate of 1000H/s   Would encourage everyone invested in this coin with CPU power to spare, to click on the link below. link will be up soon.  Traders Advantage: Top 10 Claimed Addresses on the rich list will have access to all trades and portfolio activity/status in near real time. There will be a fee for those who are not on top 10 list but would like to have access to such information. All fees will be added to the reserve fund.  MultiPool: http://hashgoal.com/  ""Holy Grail"" - Financial Instrument Will not disclose any information about this project at this time, but I do believe this will take SaluS to a whole new level if it gets off the ground.

0,https://github.com/SullyVo/Lendingclub-loan.git,"1 Introduction LendingClub is a peer to peer lending company in which their product allows consumers to both invest and borrow loans. They offer multiple kinds of loans like student loans, personal loans, auto refinancing loans and even business loans. The borrowers who are interested in obtaining loans will get a loan grade assigned to them which affect their interest rates and the amount of money they can borrow. A lot of the LendingClub data leads to insightful conclusions about the borrowing and investing patterns of all kinds of individuals. Through our investigation, we will explain patterns and similarities of the behaviors of borrowers and investors. 1.1 Questions of Interest We intend to start off with exploratory data analysis of all the factors involved to find patterns and relationships. We will look at the data from multiple angles to get a sense of the intricacies that lie within the data. We will additionally match the trend we see in the data to external events to try to explain why such is happening. We will also conduct time series decomposition in regards to the average loan amounts being requested. We will take a look at the trend and the seasonality so that we can better forecast spikes in demand. After, we will try to fit prediction models in order to answer a couple questions: namely whether a loan request from a client should be funded or not from the perspective of the bank, and what interest rate a borrower would get for a loan from the perspective of a client. After finding good models, we will deconstruct them in order to get a deeper sense of the important aspects in such decisions. 1.2 Dataset The dataset we are using is a compilation of data on loans issued by LendingClub from the period 2007 to 2015. The data includes information on the current loan status (how much has been funded so far, how much has been paid off, etc) as well as information about the borrower (occupation, income, credit score, etc). This data lends itself to a variety of interesting financial analysis, notably time series analysis since the data is date stamped. We will touch on a number of variables present in the dataset throughout the course of this analysis. We will consolidate the meanings of all these variables here for future reference. ‚Ä¢ loan_amnt: listed amount of the loan applied for by the borrower ‚Ä¢ funded_amnt: total amount committed to that loan at that point in time ‚Ä¢ funded_amnt_inv: total amount committed by investors for that loan at that point in time ‚Ä¢ term: number of payments on the loan. Values are in months and can be either 36 or 60 ‚Ä¢ int_rate: interest rate on the loan University of California, Davis ‚Ä¢ installment: monthly payment owed by the borrower ‚Ä¢ grade: loan grade that corresponds to the risk of the loan ‚Ä¢ loan_status: current status of the loan ‚Ä¢ total_bal_il: total current balance of all installment accounts ‚Ä¢ emp_title: job title of the borrower ‚Ä¢ next_pymnt_d: next scheduled payment date ‚Ä¢ sec_app_mort_acc: number of mortgage accounts at time of application for the secondary applicant More information about the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data",,5

AEON is for people who want to pay and live freely, who want to be part of the cryptocurrency revolution and want to try something new. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol and uses the CryptoNight-Lite[1] algorithm, and features: - True anonymity & data protection - Untraceable payments uses ring signature - Unlinkable transactions with random data by the sender - Blockchain analysis resistant - CPU/GPU mining, ASIC-resistant   Roadmap April 26, 2015 - new roadmap announced Mobile-friendly PoW and block time (released) GUI wallet (in progress) 32-bit and ARM support (released, but requires low memory footprint below) Low memory footprint (in progress) Signature trimming  Blockchain pruning (test release available) Multisig and payment channels (instant payments)   Development Team: Lead developer: smooth Release engineering, Q/A, support: Arux Other roles: open (PM smooth) Original developer (as Monero fork): anonymous   Bounties: None currently open.

Start mining from the wallet using start_mining command   Windows Compilation: (provided by community member cryptrol) Compile steps for Windows x64 using MSVC First of all let\'s get all the tools we need : - Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013 (It\'s a free version of visual studio with some license limitations).   You can uncheck the web development tools and SQL tools since you won\'t use them for building AEON.   This will take time to download and install and you will have to reboot upon completion. - Download and install cMake for windows from : http://www.cmake.org/download/ (Win32 install) - Download Boost 1.57 from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ , use the zip or 7zip archive and extract.   You can use c:\\boost_1_57_0 since this is what I am using for this steps. - Download and install Github for Windows from https://windows.github.com/ (This also includes a Git shell that we will use later).  Now the nasty part compile & build time ! - Build Boost :   Open a command line and type : Code:  > cd c:\\boost_1_57_0   > bootstrap.bat   > b2 --toolset=msvc variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static address-model=64 - Open the Git Shell (or Git bash) depending what you downloaded previously and do. Code:  > git clone https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.git   > cd aeon   > mkdir build   > cd build   > cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12 Win64"" -DBOOST_ROOT=c:\\boost_1_57_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=c:\\boost_1_57_0\\stage\\lib ..   > MSBuild Project.sln /p:Configuration=release /m    You should now find the exe files under build/src/release . Aeon isn\'t a cryptocurrency. It\'s a lifestyle. It\'s about polished perfection, attained by breaking the rules with calculated mastery of the art. It\'s about respecting history and pushing innovation forward at the same time. It\'s about more than just math: it\'s a vision of a world where luxury is the same as entry-level, and the limits are the heavens themselves. If you\'re just buying Aeon to get rich, don\'t even bother. Aeon needs more than just the next wave of crypto speculators: we\'re looking for the truly elite. But if you think you have what it takes to redefine global finance and discover new magnitudes of wealth in the process... Well, Aeon is ready for you. Are you ready for Aeon? ",,5

0,https://github.com/jstjyoti/Smart-India-Hackathon--team-DigIndia-.git,"{""Smart India Hackathon 2018  Identification of meritorious students in primary education  Problem Statement:-  Gujarat government has nearly 90 lac students studying in primary education across state. They are in different cities and villages across state. There is no mechanism to identify bright students who are performing well in study, sports or other activities. Web portal can be designed to acquire date about such students and can be analyzed on different parameters. What Exact Problem is being solved? : Such identified students can be provided with extra resources or special attention can be given to their upbringing.  Abstract  To identify meritorious students firstly all the educational institutions need to upload the results of students as well as points of extra curriculum activity (activity name, score out of 10 for performance) to the database for a student according to the current class of study. Aadhar number for all the students will always be given (from there students details will be verified).A parent or any other nongovernment institute can also upload scanned copy of result or certificate of any student with his/her Aadhar number and their own details. Admin will Cross-check and verify it for the update in the database. One‚Äôs (schools and institutions) first login or registration, there will be a unique token, (user id and password) to the Portal. That login will be further verified. So every institution will have a unique user id and password and students' details will be uploaded yearly and updates will be done twice in a year.  The second fold of the solution is to sort the data according to the merit of students. The designed application will perform the operation with the provided data and present a lesser (according to requirement) students' details. There should be some methods (a faster and optimal Algorithm to sort data by marks and activity score from database Base will be adopted i.e., any tree type-level representation) to sort the data (details) of meritorious students from provided records of all the students.  The third and final part is providing the list of meritorious students to the education department and university. Each official and university will also have a login section. The list of meritorious students will be provided according to year, required field. The education department or university can also post the facilities provided to the selected and shortlisted student as a notice.  Therefore, we are going to solve the stated problem by providing a Web-based application comprising of Web portal and secured database to identify meritorious students in primary education according to data (100%) uploaded and retrieved from several institutions and selected meritorious students list will be provided to (according to specification of different facilities 20-30%) to Education Department and Universities.  Keywords:  Aadhar Number as Primary key of Student Table. Online WEB-portal. Update Records every year to keep a check on the improvement, Standardization & Soring data based on Z ‚Äì stat to filter out the meritorious students on the basis of acads and extra-curricular activities. Tree type-level representation of Database i.e. Admin ‚Äì Institute ‚Äì Student. Use Case :- Choice Based selection of meritorious student from data set. For instances if the requirement is only limited to academics, they can refer to the website to fetch a list of top scorers say top 100 or top 200 students. Again if the requirement is limited to selection of Extra-curricular activity like ‚Äì singing, painting, dancing etc they can fetch the list of students having expertise in that particular field only. Identification of poor meritorious students and Funding based support from different NGO‚Äôs, organizations and donations if they want to provide. Supervising data based on entries done in every year (Region based) to keep a check on the individual growth of a student. For instances, a diligent student say X has been receiving scholarship every year now say that X student‚Äôs data has not been registered in Database in the next year. Thus there is a decay of GDP in the sample space. To highlight the social issues such as Child Labour, child trafficking, by year wise regulation Data. To prevent the girl child marriage on the basis of Dataset by the investigation Team. For instance if a girl found not registering in the consecutive Year, an investigation team can take action accordingly. Special Features: The school should submit their data to get a recognition as well as to be in sight of fund providing parties (governmental or non-governmental). Students will be benefited as direct communication is in between officials and student and no middle man in between. ‚Ä¢ Data analysis will be the key point to identification using assignment of z-marks by standard normal distribution. Technology Stack:  We are to make a Web-based app, in a microlithic structure format, where the app structure is broken into different fragments, which does the different job. One part will be taking in the to the database from a web portal designed using CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Servlet. Computation of the sorted data and the various mathematical calculations i.e. arranging the sorted data according to given criteria etc on a mathematical platform powered by JAVA. Another part will be integrated with the API's of various Education Department and Universities to provide them up with shortlisted meritorious students, integrating with their personal choices and cut-offs, and also where shortlisted students will be notified by notice posted. Keeping in mind the ease of obtaining marks and details which has increased throughout the years. In the web app, after one's first login or registration, each part of the education department, university and institution have a unique token, (user id and password) to the database. Coming to the part of its database, My SQL or Oracle or Mongo DB can be used with a firmed dashboard powered by python or JavaScript on a network frame. Since the app will be containing huge academic details of many students, so a strong encryption algorithm is to be used for data integrity and data security. AES-256 or MD5 would be best to use to protect the data in the database and for authentication Biometric data will also be preserved.""}",,4

0,https://github.com/NamanBardiya/APPLICATION-OF-CHIT-FUND-SYSTEM-WITH-CRYPTO-PAYMENTS.git,"OBJECTIVES:-  Our idea focuses on building a cryptocurrency for P&G, say P&G coin which would be used for cashless transaction and using them for chit fund system in order to popularize crypto payments among suppliers and retailers. This P&G coin will be the use case of block chain. Hence it would be more secure compared to other cashless payment methods. Value of each coin could be decided by company as per their profits or any other criteria.  HOW CHIT FUND SYSTEM WORKS:-  Supplier and retailer will have a choice whether they want to be a part of the chit fund system. Each subscriber in the chit fund would be asked to keep a bid, say one P&G coin, suppose there are 50 subscribers in this chain, so the total bid amount would be 50 P&G coins. A lucky name would be picked up and 45 P&G coins will be served in the account of that lucky supplier or retailer. Rest 5 coins would be distributed among rest of the members. This withdrawal of lucky names would be done monthly and will continue for 50 months, as there are 50 subscribers, every member will get a chance to win the fund. Once a particular subscriber wins, we can decrease his probability to win next time, so that everybody gets a chance to win. Actual chit fund system works with a little difference in India. It was given below in the uploaded images. Chit fund system can bring many suppliers and retailers who believes cash payments as more secure way of transaction to crypto payment methods. Hence cashless economy of P&G would increase with more secure way of transaction i.e by using P&G coin Block chain.  POST CAMPAIGN WORK:-  Our idea of collaborating chit funds with block chain may or may not be selected for this innovation challenge , but we are and we will continue working on it because we believe it is not about winning or loosing in the challenge but its about what practical knowledge we gain and implement by putting all our interest in these miraculous field called block chain Technology.",,2

That worldwide concern regarding Water-Energy-Food nexus has led controversy within the existing international and regional legal systems such as policy harmonization debates between EU and her member states regarding water, food and energy domains even though food as a sub-domain of common agricultural policy was predominately a common concern at the EU level since its origin. Concurrently, in 2010, UN Resolution 64/292 explicitly recognized human right to clean drinking water and German Federal Government initiated, for the first time as such, an on-line resource platform for Water-Energy-Food Security nexus funded by EU and in partnership with World Economic Forum, WEF and IFPRI. Subsequently Bonn Conference 2011 on ‚ÄòThe water Energy Food Security Nexus ‚Äì Solutions for the Green Economy‚Äô recognized the nexus perspective and provided the guiding principles for the nexus which drawn outstanding policy discourse in the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio 2012. Consecutively, in 2012, US National Intelligence Council published their report on ‚ÄòGlobal Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds‚Äô, where the nexus is declared as the fourth out of five most emerging global trends. Since then, subsequently, many governments like US, Germany, Brazil etc. as well as regional and international organizations like EU, UNWater and OECD have started policy discourse on how to recognize nexus and manage nexus resources using innovation and technology while there is no legal definition of such nexus. Very recently, on 25 September 2015, UN Resolution 70/1 on ‚ÄòTransforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development‚Äô declared 17 sustainable development goals where goal 2, 6, and 7 deals with food, water and energy security respectively. In addition, paragraph 16 of the said Resolution explicitly specified the need to bridge digital divide and to develop knowledge society using ICT as a means. This utterance of the said UN Resolution is coherent with the EU Decision 456/2005/EC which clearly emphasised to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. However, in the case of nexus, following major problems are not in favour of implementing mentioned UN Resolution and EU Decision - ",,2

Christof Koch doubts the possibility of ""intelligent"" machines attaining consciousness, because ""[e]ven the most sophisticated brain simulations are unlikely to produce conscious feelings."" (p. 48.) According to Koch, ""Whether machines can become sentient [is important] for ethical reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers\' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible ‚Äì the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation. The alternative, embodied by IIT [Integrated Information Theory], is that computers will remain only supersophisticated machinery, ghostlike empty shells, devoid of what we value most: the feeling of life itself.""

A stumbling block to AI has been an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. An example is the ""pronoun disambiguation problem"": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence refers. (p. 61.) E McGaughey, \'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away?
