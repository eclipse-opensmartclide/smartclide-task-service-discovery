Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. Chat bots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centres and Internet gaming. Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment. In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individuals’ lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff. This healthcare chatbot system will help hospitals to provide healthcare support online 24 x 7, it answers deep as well as general questions. It also helps to generate leads and automatically delivers the information of leads to sales. By asking the questions in series it helps patients by guiding what exactly he/she is looking for. ",,24

Falcon provides a visual environment for automating the workflow of extracting and transforming web data. After specifying the target website url, the web data extraction module provides a visual environment for designing automated workflows for harvesting data, going beyond HTML/XML parsing of static content to automate end user interactions yielding data that would otherwise not be immediately visible. Once extracted, the software provides full data preparation capabilities that are used for harmonizing and cleansing the web data.   For consuming the results, Falcon provides several options. It has its own visualization and dashboarding module to help criminal investigators gain the insights that they need. It also provides APIs that offer full access to everything that can be done on our platform, allowing web data to be integrated directly.     FALCON is capable of crawling ten million links and scrape one million links per month using Celery Worker.

LSI allows a search engine to determine what a page is about outside of specifically matching search query text. It looks at  “Themes” instead of “Keywords”.  Linear Algebra techniques used in the project: Singular Value Decomposition, Cosine Similarity, Matrix properties.  Dataset:   “Sci.space” news group from 20 news groups dataset, available in the Scikit-Learn library. It contains 400 news articles related to space.    SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): SVD is a matrix decomposition algorithm, it decomposes a matrix into 3 matrices which are a set to transformations. Decomposition leads to an orthogonal matrix U, Diagonal matrix S and a Diagonal Matrix V. This is the best possible transformation of a matrix. In this decomposition method we are looking for a set of orthonormal basis in the row space that when multiplied by the original matrix goes to an orthonormal basis in the column space.Av1\xa0= σ1u1\xa0 Av2\xa0= σ2u2\xa0",,11

In this project, given an incomplete binary matrix of students’ performances over a  set of questions, estimating the probability of success or fail over unanswered questions is of  interest. This problem is formulated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) which leads  to a biconvex optimization problem (this formulation is based on SPARFA [4]). The resulting  optimization problem is a hard problem to deal with due to the existence of many local minima.  On the other hand, when the size of the matrix of students’ performances increase, the existing  algorithms are not successful; therefore, an efficient algorithm is required to solve this problem  for large matrices. In this project, a parallel algorithm (i.e., a parallel version of SPARFA) is  developed to solve the biconvex optimization problem and tested via a number of generated  matrices.  Keywords: parallel non-convex optimization, matrix factorization, sparse factor analysis  1 Introduction  Educational systems have witnessed a substantial transition from traditional educational methods  mainly using text books, lectures, etc. to newly developed systems which are artificial intelligent- based systems and personally tailored to the learners [4]. Personalized Learning Systems (PLSs) and  Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are two more well-known instances of such recently developed  educational systems. PLSs take into account learners’ individual characteristics then customize  the learning experience to the learners’ current situation and needs [2]. As computerized learning  environments, ITSs model and track student learning states [1, 6, 7]. Latent Factor Model and  Bayesian Knowledge Tracing are main classes in ITSs [3]. These new approaches encompass  computational models from different disciplines including cognitive and learning sciences, education,  1  computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, operations research, and other fields. More details  can be found in [1, 4–6].  Recently, [4] developed a new machine learning-based model for learning analytics, which approximate  a students knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate  the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. This model calculates the  probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their  understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each  questions intrinsic difficulty [4]. They proposed a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution to  the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem. However, the scalability of SPARFA  when the number of questions and students significantly increase has not been studied yet.",,10

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent medical conditions in people today Hospital readmission for diabetic patients is a major concern in the United States. Over $250 million dollars was spent on treatment of readmitted diabetic inpatients in 2011 alone. Diabetes is chronic and does not have any specific cure.   Objective:- Hospital readmission rates for certain conditions are now considered an indicator of hospital quality, and also affect the cost of care adversely. Hospital readmissions of diabetic patients are expensive as hospitals face penalties if their readmission rate is higher than expected and reflects the inadequacies in health care system. For these reasons, it is important for the hospitals to improve focus on reducing readmission rates. Identify the key factors that influence readmission for diabetes and to predict the probability of patient readmission.   Approach:- The dataset chosen is that available on the UCI website which contains the patient data for the past 10 years for 130 hospitals. The code has been written in Python using different libraries like scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib etc. Different machine learning techniques for classification and regression like Logistic regression, Random forest etc have been used to achieve the objective.

Digital journalists can use such tools to extract frequently appearing terms, and to analyze the trend of a particular news brand or stories about a social event. Articles, analyses and documents written in Chinese have become increasingly important for multimedia stories about China. Available Chinese archives on the Internet might contain stories that require digital journalists to apply appropriate topic modeling tools. Unlike English and other alphabetic languages, the basic structural unit of Chinese language is character encoded in Guobiao GB18030 or Unicode.

0,https://github.com/attaoveisi/Coupling_ABAQUS_MATLAB.git,"we introduce a new framework for running the finite element (FE) packages inside an online Loop together with MATLAB. Contrary to the Hardware-in-the-Loop techniques (HiL), in the proposed Software-in-the-Loop framework (SiL), the FE package represents a simulation platform replicating the real system which can be out of access due to several strategic reasons, e.g., costs and accessibility. Practically, SiL for sophisticated structural design and multi-physical simulations provides a platform for preliminary tests before prototyping and mass production. This feature may reduce the new product’s costs significantly and may add several flexibilities in implementing different instruments with the goal of shortlisting the most cost-effective ones before moving to real-time experiments for the civil and mechanical systems. The proposed SiL interconnection is not limited to ABAQUS as long as the host FE package is capable of executing user-defined commands in FORTRAN language. The focal point of this research is on using the compiled FORTRAN subroutine as a messenger between ABAQUS/CAE kernel and MATLAB Engine. In order to show the generality of the proposed scheme, the limitations of the available SiL schemes in the literature are addressed in this paper. Additionally, all technical details for establishing the connection between FEM and MATLAB are provided for the interested reader. Finally, two numerical sub-problems are defined for offline and online post-processing, i.e., offline optimization and closed-loop system performance analysis in control theory.  Keywords: software-in-the-loop; finite element; optimal placement; structural optimization; vibration control.",,7
0,https://github.com/LeadingIndiaAI/Wake-UP-word-detection.git,"Wake-up-word(WUW)system is an emerging development in recent times. Voice interaction with systems have made life ease and aids in multi-tasking. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon have developed a custom wake-word engine, which are addressed by words such as ‘Hey Siri’. ‘Ok Google’, ‘Cortana’, ‘Alexa’. Our project focuses initially only detection and response to a customized wake-up command. The wake-up command used is “GOLUMOLU”. A wake-up-word detection system search for specific word and reads the word, where it rejects all other words, phrases and sounds. WUW system needs only less memory space, low computational cost and high precision. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have reduced the complexity, computational time, latency, thus the efficiency of system has improved. Deep learning has improved the efficiency of automatic speech recognition(SR), where wake word detection is a subset of SR but unlike keyword spotting and voice recognition. A deep learning RNN model is used for the training of the network. RNN are specifically used in case of temporal sequence data and has the ability to process data of different length but of same dimension. For training a model, labelled dataset is needed. We generated three forms of data: golumolu, negative and background. Such that, the model learns circumspectly and attentively detects when specific word found. To start communication with system, the wake word should be delivered. The main task of WUW detection system is to detect the speech, to identify WUW words among spoken words, to check whether the word spoken in altering context.",,7

Penetration depth of microwave signals into the ground depends on the incidence angle and wavelength of radar pulses and also on the soil properties such as moisture content and textural composition. It has been observed that the longer wavelengths have higher penetration in the soil but the penetration capability decreases with increasing dielectric behaviour of the soil. Moisture content in the soil can significantly increase its dielectric constant. Various empirical models have been proposed that evaluate the dielectric behaviour of soil-water mixture as a function of moisture content and texture of the soil. In this analysis we have used two such empirical models, the Dobson model and the Hallikainen model, to calculate the penetration depth at L- and C-band in soil and compared their results. We found that both of these models give different penetration depth and show different sensitivity towards the soil composition. Hallikainen model is more sensitive to soil composition as compared to Dobson model. Finally, we explore the penetration depth at different incidence angle for the proposed L- and S-band sensor of upcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission by using Hallikainen empirical model. We found that the soil penetration depth of SAR signals into the ground decreases with the increase in soil moisture content, incident angle and frequency.  References [1] A. Singh, G. K. Meena, S.
