0,https://github.com/najeebkhan12/pakistani-sign-language-recognition-system.git,We developed a system that would translate Pakistan Sign Language to text and audio form in real time. The system is limited to recognition of 15 pre-specified greeting sentences. System takes input from a Kinect Camera device as a person practices signs in front of it. The system generates the sentences on the screen being practiced in the sign. System uses depth information right from the Kinect device and computes the time-series of a sign being practiced. System is trained on features extracted from 15 sentences using Random Forest Machine Algorithm. System evaluates the input sign and on model established after training and displays the word against the sign practiced on the screen as suggested by model. System can be extended to commercial scale based on the schema proposed by the project. The intended subjects of this technology are the people who suffer from any kind of hearing loss and knows Pakistan Sign Language and those who want to communicate to a mute person and do not know Pakistan Sign Language.,,4

The result showed an upward trend in the number of immigrants to Canada. Part II: I sorted the top 5 (India, China, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Philippines and Pakistan) and least 5 (Palau, Western Sahara, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia and San Marino) immigrating countries and plotted individual country’s trend against their peers.

It is better for the customers to find the leading dealers of their cars, who not only have new stock of new models of the vehicles but also provide all necessary information about the vehicle. When the leading brands introduce their new models of the vehicles, they carry out their publicity by showing different features of the vehicle, its quality and something special, which is introduced in that vehicle.  The introduction of the new cars of the leading brands in the market can break the monopoly of the big companies, which dominate in the local market. The clients should check the basic necessary features including style of the vehicle, comfort level and fuel efficiency and its performance. The people, who like driving fast and safe, they always look for the vehicles having amazing acceleration and best comfort level. In case of new vehicles, you will have to rely over the test drive of the vehicle but sufficient driving experience is not given. But they have to check different reviews over the vehicle and they have to rely on the information to make the decision.  Various blogs are maintained with the just and right information about the vehicles and they do comparison of different vehicles with vehicles of other brands and the clients can check the qualities of different vehicles. The information is also given to the clients about the import of any particular car, its financing and insurance. They can choose the best and most suitable plan for the insurance of the vehicles of the leading insurance companies to get financial benefits over their vehicles. If they are taking interest in buying the used cars, then they can do online vehicle verification through MTMIS Pakistan and they can get verified their vehicle before buy it.  If the clients have car and they want to sell it then they can post an ad and they can get quick response over sale of the vehicle. They need to share all necessary information like model, color, engine position and fuel efficiency of the vehicles. They can also quote suitable rate of the vehicle, which they demand for the sale of their vehicle. If the clients look for the auto parts, then they can make contact to get the suitable auto parts of the vehicles of their choice.  The information regarding new and used bikes is also shared with the clients and they can find new bikes of the leading companies with latest models having latest features. The clients need to know about the dealers, who deal with the new bikes and they can get the latest information and the special features, which are introduced in the new bikes. They need to make contact with the leading dealers of their city as the bikes with these dealers are available at the most reasonable rates. The clients can get the information about the used bikes and these used bikes are easily available. The clients should make decision about the particular model and get information about features of the used vehicles. The rates of the used bikes are varied and negotiable.",,1
