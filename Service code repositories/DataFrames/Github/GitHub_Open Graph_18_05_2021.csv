Working Interface Details: We have provided user choice to see current market prices based on two choices: market wise or commodity wise use increase assesibility options.  Market wise: User have to provide State,District and Market name and then select market wise button. Then user will be shown the prices of all the commodities present in the market in graphical format, so that he can analyse the rates on one scale. This feature is mostly helpful for a regular buyer to decide the choice of commodity to buy. He is also given feature to download the data in a tabular format(csv) for accurate analysis.  Commodity Wise: User have to provide State,District and Commodity name and then select Commodity wise button. Then user will be shown the prices of all the markets present in the region with the commodity in graphical format, so that he can analyse the cheapest commodity rate. This feature is mostly helpful for wholesale buyers. He is also given feature to download the data in a tabular format(csv) for accurate analysis.  On the first activity user is also given forecasting choice. It can be used to forecast the wholesale prices of various commodities at some later year. Regression techniques on timeseries data is used to predict future prices. Select the type of item and click link for future predictions.  There are 3 java files Forecasts, DisplayGraphs, DisplayGraphs2 ..... Please change the localhost ""server_name"" at time of testing as the server name changes each time a new server is made.  Things Used: We have used pandas , numpy , scikit learn , seaborn and matplotlib libraries for the same . The dataset is thoroughly analysed using different function available in pandas in my .iPynb file . Not just in-built functions are used but also many user made functions are made to make the working smooth . Various graphs like pointplot , heat-map , barplot , kdeplot , distplot, pairplot , stripplot , jointplot, regplot , etc are made and also deployed on the android app as well .  To integrate the android app and machine learning analysis outputs , we have used Flask to host our laptop as the server . We have a separate file for the Flask as server.py . Where all the the necessary stuff of clint request and server response have been dealt with . We have used npm package ngrok for tunneling purpose and hosting .  A different .iPynb file is used for the time series predictions using regression algorithms and would send the csv file of prediction along with the graph to the andoid app when given a request .",,31

Just look at the published script !   VAR_modeling_script.m contains the modeling of the whole order book as VEC/VAR process.  It uses the great VAR/VEC Joahnsen cointegration framework.  After calibrating your VAR model, you then assess the impact of an order  using shock scenario (sensitivity analysis) to the VAR process.  We deal with 3 scenarii : normal limit order, aggressive limit order & normal market order).  Play section by section the script (to open up figures which contain a lot of graphs).   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.   The second item is entirely based on the following paper :  http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf   It contains a mupad document : symbolic_demo.mn  I did struggle to get something nice with the symbolic toolbox.  I was not able to drive a continuous workflow and had to recode some equations myself.  I nevertheless managed to get a closed form solution for the simplified linear cost model.   It contains a MATLAB demonstrating script : working_script.m  For more sophisticated cost model, there is no more closed form  and we there highlighted MATLAB numerical optimization abilities (fmincon).   It contains an Optimization Apps you can install.  Just launch the optimization with the default parameters.  And then switch the slider between volatility risk and liquidation costs  to see the trading strategies evolve on the efficient frontier.

The script computes the Average Hash of each extracted image, then graphs the images if they meet the similarity threshold. The script can be used as a technique for visually identifying malware campaigns involving documents. To use the script, supply a directory containing OOXML files. If LibreOffice is in your PATH you can optionally convert non-OOXML Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Rich Text File documents to OOXML. The script outputs DOT files that can be exported as images using Graphviz. If Graphviz is in your PATH you can also export to an SVG (preferred) or PNG image.","maldoc,malware,image",7

0,https://github.com/rpadma/Rappay.git,"{""My entry for ICICI Bank Hackathon 2016- Proposed a mobile app with the following functionality     1)      A bank account is at the crux of a user’s relationship with the bank. However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user’s favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group\'s work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff\'s exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C\'s payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo\'s Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group\'s first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C\'s auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C\'s Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We\'re now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C\'s Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C\'s Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C\'s MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",,6

ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版，适合windows操作系统，比如：Xp、win7、win8、win10系统。浏览器自带翻译插件和YouTube视频下载脚本，方便且实用。压缩包文件的格式是7z，如果解压出错，用7解压软件来解压（<a href=""https://sparanoid.com/lab/7z/"" rel=""nofollow"">7z解压软件下载地址</a>）。</p> <p><strong>注意</strong>：软件都是采用加密方式的，但为了更稳定、更安全的翻墙，建议卸载国产杀毒软件，至少翻墙时不要用它们！因为很多国产杀毒软件，比如360安全卫生、360杀毒软件、腾讯管家、金山卫士等不仅仅会起干扰作用，造成软件无法正常使用或速度变慢，它们与防火墙还有千丝万缕的关系!其实win10自带的defender就有杀毒的功能，如果还需要安全软件，可以用国外的杀毒软件<a href=""http://files.avast.com/iavs9x/avast_free_antivirus_setup_offline.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">avast</a>，防火墙<a href=""https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall/releases/download/v.2.3.4/simplewall-2.3.4-setup.exe"">simplewall</a>，还有清理软件<a href=""http://downloads.wisecleaner.com/soft/WiseCare365.exe""

ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版,可以按照顺序依次尝试。由于国内网络环境不同、地区不同，封锁强度会不同，所以使用效果会有差别，有的地区几乎所有的软件都能使用，有的只能用几款，因此具体哪款软件适合你的网络环境，需要你自己来尝试。内存低于2G的电脑建议用<a

        6 return 0;         7 }       【第二步】预处理         预处理过程实质上是处理“#”，将#include包含的头文件直接拷贝到hell.c当中；将#define定义的宏进行替换，同时将代码中没用的注释部分删除等。        （1）将所有的#define删除，并且展开所有的宏定义。说白了就是字符替换        （2）处理所有的条件编译指令，#ifdef #ifndef #endif等，就是带#的那些        （3）处理#include，将#include指向的文件插入到该行处        （4）删除所有注释        （5）添加行号和文件标示，这样的在调试和编译出错的时候才知道是是哪个文件的哪一行        （6）保留#pragma编译器指令，因为编译器需要使用它们。        【第三步】编译        （1）词法分析，        （2）语法分析        （3）语义分析        （4）优化后生成相应的汇编代码        【第四步】链接 常用的编译器：         Cygwin、Mingw32、DJGPP、Dev-C++、GNU C++、MSC 5.0、6.0、7.0、MSQC 1.0、2.5、MSVC 1.0、4.2、6.0、7.0、Visual C++等等。 ###C语言中主函数的返回值可以返回什么东西，主函数的参数又是如何确定的？        main函数的返回值用于说明程序的退出状态。如果返回0，则代表程序正常退出。返回其它数字的含义则由系统决定。通常，返回非零代表程序异常退出。返回值为1的时候则代表程序运行遇到问题失败。        主函数的第一个参数是一个整数，它表示第二个参数里的指针个数，主函数的第二个参数是一个字符指针数组，其中每个指针代表一个字符串，所有这些字符串的内容都来自于用户的命令。        argc是命令行总的参数个数，argv[]是argc个参数，其中第0个参数是程序的全名，以后的参数命令行后面跟的用户输入的参数，char *argv[]是一个字符数组,其大小是int argc,主要用于命令行参数， char*envp[]用来取得系统的环境变量。       ",,5

0,https://github.com/ygdwn455/nlp.git,"## 基于LSTM三分类的文本情感分析  ### 背景介绍  文本情感分析作为NLP的常见任务，具有很高的实际应用价值。本文将采用LSTM模型，训练一个能够识别文本postive, neutral, negative三种情感的分类器。  本文的目的是快速熟悉LSTM做情感分析任务，所以本文提到的只是一个baseline，并在最后分析了其优劣。对于真正的文本情感分析，在本文提到的模型之上，还可以做很多工作，以后有空的话，笔者可以再做优化。  ### 理论介绍  #### RNN应用场景  RNN相对于传统的神经网络，它允许我们对向量序列进行操作：输入序列、输出序列、或大部分的输入输出序列。如下图所示，每一个矩形是一个向量，箭头则表示函数（比如矩阵相乘）。输入向量用红色标出，输出向量用蓝色标出，绿色的矩形是RNN的状态（下面会详细介绍）。从做到右：（1）没有使用RNN的Vanilla模型，从固定大小的输入得到固定大小输出（比如图像分类）。（2）序列输出（比如图片字幕，输入一张图片输出一段文字序列）。（3）序列输入（比如情感分析，输入一段文字然后将它分类成积极或者消极情感）。（4）序列输入和序列输出（比如机器翻译：一个RNN读取一条英文语句然后将它以法语形式输出）。（5）同步序列输入输出（比如视频分类，对视频中每一帧打标签）。我们注意到在每一个案例中，都没有对序列长度进行预先特定约束，因为递归变换（绿色部分）是固定的，而且我们可以多次使用。  ![](http://7xritj.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/16-5-25/61310852.jpg)   #### word2vec 算法  建模环节中最重要的一步是特征提取，在自然语言处理中也不例外。在自然语言处理中，最核心的一个问题是，如何把一个句子用数字的形式有效地表达出来？如果能够完成这一步，句子的分类就不成问题了。显然，一个最初等的思路是：给每个词语赋予唯一的编号1,2,3,4...，然后把句子看成是编号的集合，比如假设1,2,3,4分别代表“我”、“你”、“爱”、“恨”，那么“我爱你”就是[1, 3, 2]，“我恨你”就是[1, 4, 2]。这种思路看起来有效，实际上非常有问题，比如一个稳定的模型会认为3跟4是很接近的，因此[1, 3, 2]和[1, 4, 2]应当给出接近的分类结果，但是按照我们的编号，3跟4所代表的词语意思完全相反，分类结果不可能相同。因此，这种编码方式不可能给出好的结果。  读者也许会想到，我将意思相近的词语的编号凑在一堆（给予相近的编号）不就行了？嗯，确实如果，如果有办法把相近的词语编号放在一起，那么确实会大大提高模型的准确率。可是问题来了，如果给出每个词语唯一的编号，并且将相近的词语编号设为相近，实际上是假设了语义的单一性，也就是说，语义仅仅是一维的。然而事实并非如此，语义应该是多维的。  比如我们谈到“家园”，有的人会想到近义词“家庭”，从“家庭”又会想到“亲人”，这些都是有相近意思的词语；另外，从“家园”，有的人会想到“地球”，从“地球”又会想到“火星”。换句话说，“亲人”、“火星”都可以看作是“家园”的二级近似，但是“亲人”跟“火星”本身就没有什么明显的联系了。此外，从语义上来讲，“大学”、“舒适”也可以看做是“家园”的二级近似，显然，如果仅通过一个唯一的编号，是很难把这些词语放到适合的位置的。  ![](http://kexue.fm/usr/uploads/2015/08/1893427039.png)  **Word2Vec：高维来了**  从上面的讨论可以知道，很多词语的意思是各个方向发散开的，而不是单纯的一个方向，因此唯一的编号不是特别理想。那么，多个编号如何？换句话说，将词语对应一个多维向量？不错，这正是非常正确的思路。  为什么多维向量可行？首先，多维向量解决了词语的多方向发散问题，仅仅是二维向量就可以360度全方位旋转了，何况是更高维呢（实际应用中一般是几百维）。其次，还有一个比较实际的问题，就是多维向量允许我们用变化较小的数字来表征词语。怎么说？我们知道，就中文而言，词语的数量就多达数十万，如果给每个词语唯一的编号，那么编号就是从1到几十万变化，变化幅度如此之大，模型的稳定性是很难保证的。如果是高维向量，比如说20维，那么仅需要0和1就可以表达2^20=1048576220=1048576（100万）个词语了。变化较小则能够保证模型的稳定性。  扯了这么多，还没有真正谈到点子上。现在思路是有了，问题是，如何把这些词语放到正确的高维向量中？而且重点是，要在没有语言背景的情况下做到这件事情？（换句话说，如果我想处理英语语言任务，并不需要先学好英语，而是只需要大量收集英语文章，这该多么方便呀！）在这里我们不可能也不必要进行更多的原理上的展开，而是要介绍：而基于这个思路，有一个Google开源的著名的工具——Word2Vec。  简单来说，**Word2Vec就是完成了上面所说的我们想要做的事情——用高维向量（词向量，Word Embedding）表示词语**，并把相近意思的词语放在相近的位置，而且用的是实数向量（不局限于整数）。我们只需要有大量的某语言的语料，就可以用它来训练模型，获得词向量。词向量好处前面已经提到过一些，或者说，它就是问了解决前面所提到的问题而产生的。另外的一些好处是：词向量可以方便做聚类，用欧氏距离或余弦相似度都可以找出两个具有相近意思的词语。这就相当于解决了“一义多词”的问题（遗憾的是，似乎没什么好思路可以解决一词多义的问题。）  关于Word2Vec的数学原理，读者可以参考这系列文章。而Word2Vec的实现，Google官方提供了C语言的源代码，读者可以自行编译。而**Python的Gensim库**中也提供现成的Word2Vec作为子库（事实上，这个版本貌似比官方的版本更加强大）。  #### 句向量  接下来要解决的问题是：我们已经分好词，并且已经将词语转换为高维向量，那么句子就对应着词向量的集合，也就是矩阵，类似于图像处理，图像数字化后也对应一个像素矩阵；可是模型的输入一般只接受一维的特征，那怎么办呢？一个比较简单的想法是将矩阵展平，也就是将词向量一个接一个，组成一个更长的向量。这个思路是可以，但是这样就会使得我们的输入维度高达几千维甚至几万维，事实上是难以实现的。（如果说几万维对于今天的计算机来说不是问题的话，那么对于1000x1000的图像，就是高达100万维了！）  在自然语言处理中，通常用到的方法是递归神经网络或循环神经网络（都叫RNNs）。**它们的作用跟卷积神经网络是一样的，将矩阵形式的输入编码为较低维度的一维向量，而保留大多数有用信息**。   ![](http://kexue.fm/usr/uploads/2015/08/2067741257.png)   ### Show me the code  工程代码主要是结合参考资料2做三分类的文本情感分析;    #### 数据预处理与词向量模型训练  参考资料二中有很翔实的处理过程，包括：  1. 不同类别数据整理成输入矩阵 2. jieba分词 3. Word2Vec词向量模型训练  本文中就不做重复介绍了，想要了解的，可以去参考资料二的博文中查找。  三分类除了涉及到positive和negative两种情感外，还有一种neural情感，从原始数据集中可以提取到有语义转折的句子，“然而”，“但”都是关键词。从而可以得到3份不同语义的数据集。  #### LSTM三分类模型  代码需要注意的几点是，第一是，标签需要使用keras.utils.to_categorical来yummy，第二是LSTM二分类的参数设置跟二分有区别，选用softmax，并且loss函数也要改成categorical_crossentropy，代码如下：  ```python def get_data(index_dict,word_vectors,combined,y):      n_symbols = len(index_dict) + 1  # 所有单词的索引数，频数小于10的词语索引为0，所以加1     embedding_weights = np.zeros((n_symbols, vocab_dim)) # 初始化 索引为0的词语，词向量全为0     for word, index in index_dict.items(): # 从索引为1的词语开始，对每个词语对应其词向量         embedding_weights[index, :] = word_vectors[word]     x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(combined, y, test_size=0.2)     y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train,num_classes=3)      y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test,num_classes=3)     # print x_train.shape,y_train.shape     return n_symbols,embedding_weights,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test   ##定义网络结构 def train_lstm(n_symbols,embedding_weights,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test):     print \'Defining a Simple Keras Model...\'     model = Sequential()  # or Graph or whatever     model.add(Embedding(output_dim=vocab_dim,                         input_dim=n_symbols,                         mask_zero=True,                         weights=[embedding_weights],                         input_length=input_length))  # Adding Input Length     model.add(LSTM(output_dim=50, activation=\'tanh\'))     model.add(Dropout(0.5))     model.add(Dense(3, activation=\'softmax\')) # Dense=>全连接层,输出维度=3     model.add(Activation(\'softmax\'))      print \'Compiling the Model...\'     model.compile(loss=\'categorical_crossentropy\',                   optimizer=\'adam\',metrics=[\'accuracy\'])      print ""Train..."" # batch_size=32     model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=n_epoch,verbose=1)      print ""Evaluate...""     score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test,                                 batch_size=batch_size)      yaml_string = model.to_yaml()     with open(\'../model/lstm.yml\', \'w\') as outfile:         outfile.write( yaml.dump(yaml_string, default_flow_style=True) )     model.save_weights(\'../model/lstm.h5\')     print \'Test score:\', score ```  #### 测试  代码如下：  ```python def lstm_predict(string):     print \'loading model......\'     with open(\'../model/lstm.yml\', \'r\') as f:         yaml_string = yaml.load(f)     model = model_from_yaml(yaml_string)      print \'loading weights......\'     model.load_weights(\'../model/lstm.h5\')     model.compile(loss=\'categorical_crossentropy\',                   optimizer=\'adam\',metrics=[\'accuracy\'])     data=input_transform(string)     data.reshape(1,-1)     #print data     result=model.predict_classes(data)     # print result # [[1]]     if result[0]==1:         print string,\' positive\'     elif result[0]==0:         print string,\' neutral\'     else:         print string,\' negative\' ```  经过检测，发现，原先在二分类模型中的“不是太好”，“不错不错”这样子带有前后语义转换的句子，都能正确预测，实战效果提升明显，但是也有缺点，缺点是中性评价出现的概率不高，笔者分析原因是，首先从数据集数量和质量着手，中性数据集的数量要比其他两个数据集少一半多，并且通过简单规则“然而”，“但”提取出来的中性数据集质量也不是很高，所以才会出现偏差。总而言之，训练数据的质量是非常重要的，如何获取高质量高数量的训练样本，也就成了新的难题。   - 参考资料  [文本情感分类（二）：深度学习模型](http://spaces.ac.cn/archives/3414/)  [Shopping Reviews sentiment analysis](https://buptldy.github.io/2016/07/20/2016-07-20-sentiment%20analysis/)",,5

0,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons.git,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors\' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so","aryia-behroziuan,artificial-intelligence,wikipedia,an-ann,neural-network,android,bootstrap,csharp,deep-learning,expressjs,firebase",3

Face recognition has received substantial attention from researchers due to human activities found in various applications of security like airport, criminal detection, face tracking, forensic etc. Compared to other biometric traits like palm print, Iris, finger print etc., face biometrics can be non-intrusive. They can be taken even without user’s knowledge and further can be used for security based applications like criminal detection, face tracking, airport security, and forensic surveillance systems. Face recognition involves capturing face image from a video or from a surveillance camera. They are compared with the stored database. Face biometrics involves training known images, classify them with known classes and then they are stored in the database. When a test image is given to the system it is classified and compared with stored database. Face biometrics is a challenging field of research with various limitations imposed for a machine face recognition like variations in head pose, change in illumination, facial expression, aging, occlusion due to accessories etc.,. Various approaches were suggested by researchers in overcoming the limitations stated. 72 Automatic face recognition involves face detection, feature extraction and face recognition. Face recognition algorithms are broadly classified into two classes as image template based and geometric feature based. The template based methods compute correlation between face and one or more model templates to find the face identity. Principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, kernel methods etc. are used to construct face templates. The geometric feature based methods are used to analyze explicit local features and their geometric relations (elastic bung graph method). Multi resolution tools such as contour lets, ridge lets were found to be useful for analyzing information content of images and found its application in image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision.

Link-State Routing protocol is a main class of routing protocols.  It is performed by every switching node/router in the network.  The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node  constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the  form of a Graph, showing which nodes are connected to which  other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next  best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network.  The collection of best paths will then form the node's routing table. OSPF: ----- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol for Internet  Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into  the group of interior routing protocols, operating within a single autonomous  system (AS). OSPF is perhaps the most widely used interior gateway protocol (IGP) in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another link-state dynamic routing protocol,  is more common in large service provider networks. The most widely used exterior gateway protocol is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the principal routing protocol  between autonomous systems on the Internet.  * Advantages of link state routing (as opposed to distance vector routing) include   that link state routing converges rather quickly and    * is not subject to the count-to-infinity problem; hence, no measures to combat    this problem need to be taken. As the full network topology   * is known to every node, rather advanced routing techniques can be implemented.  * Disadvantages include that the link state information needs to be flooded through    the network, causing higher overhead than link state protocols.   * The memory and computational requirements are also higher.  OSPF is an interior gateway protocol that routes Internet Protocol (IP) packets  solely within a single routing domain (autonomous system). It gathers link state  information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network.  The topology determines the routing table presented to the Internet Layer which  makes routing decisions based solely on the destination IP address found in IP packets.  OSPF was designed to support variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) or Classless   Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing models.""}",,2

If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.  In this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.""}",,1

Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:  Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy Time: time in format hh:mm:ss Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Review criterialess  Criteria  Was a valid GitHub URL containing a git repository submitted? Does the GitHub repository contain at least one commit beyond the original fork? Please examine the plot files in the GitHub repository. Do the plot files appear to be of the correct graphics file format? Does each plot appear correct? Does each set of R code appear to create the reference plot? Reviewing the Assignments  Keep in mind this course is about exploratory graphs, understanding the data, and developing strategies. Here\'s a good quote from a swirl lesson about exploratory graphs: ""They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON\'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.""  The rubrics should always be interpreted in that context.  As you do your evaluation, please keep an open mind and focus on the positive. The goal is not to deduct points over small deviations from the requirements or for legitimate differences in implementation styles, etc. Look for ways to give points when it\'s clear that the submitter has given a good faith effort to do the project, and when it\'s likely that they\'ve succeeded. Most importantly, it\'s okay if a person did something differently from the way that you did it. The point is not to see if someone managed to match your way of doing things, but to see if someone objectively accomplished the task at hand.  To that end, keep the following things in mind:  DO  Review the source code. Keep an open mind and focus on the positive.≤/li> When in doubt, err on the side of giving too many points, rather than giving too few. Ask yourself if a plot might answer a question for the person who created it. Remember that not everyone has the same statistical background and knowledge. DON\'T:  Deduct just because you disagree with someone\'s statistical methods. Deduct just because you disagree with someone\'s plotting methods. Deduct based on aesthetics. Loading the dataless  When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:  The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine). We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates. You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime()  and as.Date() functions. Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?. Making Plotsless  Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.  First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1  For each plot you should  Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file. Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders) When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.",,1

The graph representation provided on the Code page (which you are allowed to use in your solution) and the pseudocode and algorithm discussed in class provide all the information needed. If anything is unclear in the provided materials check with us. You can read materials on how to read from a file, or read a Unix file or how to tokenize a line of code, BUT not in a sample code that deals with graphs or this specific problem. E.g. you can read tutorials about these topics, but not a solution to this problem (or a problem very similar to it). You should not share your code with any classmate or read another classmate\'s code. Part 1: Main program requirements (100 pts) Given a list of courses and their prerequisites, compute the order in which courses must be taken so that when taking a courses, all its prerequisites have already been taken. All the files that the program would read from are in Unix format (they have the Unix EOL). Provided files: ● Grading Criteria ● cycle0.txt ● data0.txt ● data0_rev.txt ● data1.txt - like data0.txt but the order of the prerequisite courses is modified on line 2. ● slides.txt (graph image) - courses given in such a way that they produce the same graph as in the image. (The last digit in the course number is the same as the vertex corresponding to it in the drawn graph. You can also see this in the vertex-to-course name correspondence in the sample run for this file.) ● run.html● data0_easy.txt - If you cannot handle the above file format, this is an easier file format that you can use, but there will be 15 points lost in this case. More details about this situation are given in Part 3. ● Unix.zip - zipped folder with all data files. ● For your reference: EOL_Mac_Unix_Windows.png - EOL symbols for Unix/Mac/Windows Specifications: 1. You can use structs, macros, typedef. 2. All the code must be in C (not C++, or any other language) 3. Global or static variables are NOT allowed. The exception is using macros to define constants for the size limits (e.g. instead of using 30 for the max course name size). E.g. #define MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH 20 4. You can use static memory (on the frame stack) or dynamic memory. (Do not confuse static memory with static variables.) 5. The program must read from the user a filename. The filename (as given by the user) will include the extension, but NOT the path. E.g.: data0.txt 6. You can open and close the file however many times you want. 7. File format: 1. Unix file. It will have the Unix EOL (end-of-line). 2. Size limits: 1. The file name will be at most 30 characters. 2. A course name will be at most 30 characters 3. A line in the file will be at most 1000 characters. 3. The file ends with an empty new line. 4. Each line (except for the last empty line) has one or more course names. 5. Each course name is a single word (without any spaces). E.g. CSE1310 (with no space between CSE and 1310). 6. There is no empty space at the end of the line. 7. There is exactly one empty space between any two consecutive courses on the same line. (You do not need to worry about having tabs or more than one empty space between 2 courses.) The first course name on each line is the course being described and the following courses are the prerequisites for it. E.g. CSE2315 CSE1310 MATH1426 ENGL13018. The first line describes course CSE2315 and it indicates that CSE2315 has 2 prerequisite courses, namely: CSE1310 and MATH1426. The second line describes course ENG1301 and it indicates that ENG1301 has no prerequisites. 9. You can assume that there is exactly one line for every course, even for those that do not have prerequisites (see ENGL1301 above). Therefore you can count the number of lines in the file to get the total number of courses. 10.The courses are not given in any specific order in the file. 8. You must create a directed graph corresponding to the data in the file. 1. The graph will have as many vertices as different courses listed in the file. 2. You can represent the vertices and edges however you want. 3. You do NOT have to use a graph struct. If you can do all the work with just the 2D table (the adjacency matrix) that is fine. You HAVE TO implement the topological sorting covered in class (as this assignment is on Graphs), but you can organize, represent and store the data however you want. 4. For the edges, you can use either the adjacency matrix representation or the adjacency list. If you use the adjacency list, keep the nodes in the list sorted in increasing order. 5. For each course that has prerequisites, there is an edge, from each prerequisite to that course. Thus the direction of the edge indicates the dependency. The actual edge will be between the vertices in the graph corresponding to these courses. E.g. file data0.txt has: c100 c300 c200 c100 c200 c100 Meaning: c100-----> c200 \\ | \\ | \\ | \\ | \\ | \\ | V V c300(The above drawing is provided here to give a picture of how the data in the file should be interpreted and the graph that represents this data. Your program should *NOT* print this drawing. See the sample run for expected program output.) From this data you should create the correspondence: vertex 0 - c100 vertex 1 - c300 vertex 2 - c200 and you can represent the graph using adjacency matrix (the row and column indexes are provided for convenience): | 0 1 2 ----------------- 0| 0 1 1 1| 0 0 0 2| 0 1 0 e.g. E[0][1] is 1 because vertex 0 corresponds to c100 and vertex 1 corresponds to c300 and c300 has c100 as a prerequisite. Notice that E[1][0] is not 1. If you use the adjacency list representation, then you can print the adjacency list. The list must be sorted in increasing order (e.g. see the list for 0). It should show the corresponding node numbers. E.g. for the above example the adjacency list will be: 0: 1, 2, 1: 2: 1, 6. 7. In order for the output to look the same for everyone, use the correspondence given here: vertex 0 for the course on the first line, vertex 1 for the course on the second line, etc. 1. Print the courses in topological sorted order. This should be done using the DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm that we covered in class and the topological sorting based on DFS discussed in class. There is no topological order if there is a cycle in the graph; in this case print an error message. If in DFV-visit when looking at the (u,v) edge, if the color of v is GRAY then there is a cycle in the graph (and therefore topological sorting is not possible). See the Lecture on topological sorting (You can find the date based on the table on the Scans page and then watch the video from that day. I have also updated the pseudocodein the slides to show that. Refresh the slides and check the date on the first page. If it is 11/26/2020, then you have the most recent version.) 8. (6 points) create and submit 1 test file. It must cover a special case. Indicate what special case you are covering (e.g. no course has any prerequisite). At the top of the file indicate what makes it a special case. Save this file as special.txt. It should be in Unix EOL format. Part 2: Suggestions for improvements (not for grade) 1. CSE Advisors also are mindful and point out to students the ""longest path through the degree"". That is longest chain of course prerequisites (e.g. CSE1310 ---> CSE1320 --> CSE3318 -->...) as this gives a lower bound on the number of semesters needed until graduation. Can you calculate for each course the LONGEST chain ending with it? E.g. in the above example, there are 2 chains ending with c300 (size 2: just c100-->c300, size 3: c100-->c200-->c300) and you want to show longest path 3 for c300. Can you calculate this number for each course? 2. Allow the user the enter a list of courses taken so far (from the user or from file) and print a list of the courses they can take (they have all the prerequisites for). 3. Ask the user to enter a desired number of courses per semester and suggest a schedule (by semester). Part 3: Implementation suggestions 1. Reading from file: (15 points) For each line in the file, the code can extract the first course and the prerequisites for it. If you cannot process each line in the file correctly, you can use a modified input file that shows on each line, the number of courses, but you would lose the 15 points dedicated to line processing. If your program works with the ""easy files"", in order to make it easy for the TAs to know which file to provide, please name your C program courses_graph_easy.c. Here is the modification shown for a new example. Instead of c100 c300 c200 c100 c200 the file would have: 1 c1003 c300 c200 c100 1 c200 1. that way the first data on each line is a number that tells how many courses (strings) follow after it on that line. Everything is separated by exactly one space. All the other specifications are the same as for the original file (empty line at the end, no space at the end of any line, length of words, etc). Here is data0_easy.txt Make a direct correspondence between vertex numbers and course names. E.g. the **first** course name on the first line corresponds to vertex 0, the **first** course name on the second line corresponds to vertex 1, etc... 2. 3. The vertex numbers are used to refer to vertices. 4. In order to add an edge in the graph you will need to find the vertex number corresponding to a given course name. E.g. find that c300 corresponds to vertex 1 and c200 corresponds to vertex 2. Now you can set E[2][1] to be 1. (With the adjacency list, add node 1 in the adjacency list for 2 keeping the list sorted.) To help with this, write a function that takes as arguments the list/array of [unique] course names and one course name and returns the index of that course in the list. You can use that index as the vertex number. (This is similar to the indexOf method in Java.) 5. To see all the non-printable characters that may be in a file, find an editor that shows them. E.g. in Notepad++ : open the file, go to View -> Show symbol -> Show all characters. YOU SHOULD TRY THIS! In general, not necessarily for this homework, if you make the text editor show the white spaces, you will know if what you see as 4 empty spaces comes from 4 spaces or from one tab or show other hidden characters. This can help when you tokenize. E.g. here I am using Notepad++ to see the EOL for files saved with Unix/Mac/Windows EOL (see the CR/LF/CRLF at the end of each line): EOL_Mac_Unix_Windows.png How to submit Submit courses_graph.c (or courses_graph_easy.c) and special.txt (the special test case you created) in Canvas . (For courses_graph_easy.c you can submit the ""easy"" files that you created.)Your program should be named courses_graph.c if it reads from the normal/original files. If instead it reads from the \'easy\' files, name it courses_graph_easy.c As stated on the course syllabus, programs must be in C, and must run on omega.uta.edu or the VM. IMPORTANT: Pay close attention to all specifications on this page, including file names and submission format. Even in cases where your answers are correct, points will be taken off liberally for non-compliance with the instructions given on this page (such as wrong file names, wrong compression format for the submitted code, and so on). The reason is that non-compliance with the instructions makes the grading process significantly (and unnecessarily) more time consuming. Contact the instructor or TA if you have any questions",,1
0,https://github.com/bkievitk/wordsimilarity.git,"Although there have been many recent advances in corpus-based tools, the techniques used to evaluate these systems have advanced little. Typically, the plausibility of a semantic space is explored by sampling nearest neighbors to a target word and evaluated based on the modeler’s intuition. Tools for visualization of these large-scale similarity spaces are nearly non-existent. Word 2 word is a new open-source tool to plot and visualize semantic spaces, allowing researchers to rapidly explore patterns in visual data representative of statistical relations between words. Words are visualized as nodes and word similarities as directed edges of varying strengths or thicknesses. The “Word 2 Word” visualization environment allows easy manipulation of graph data to test word similarity measures on their own accord or as a comparison between multiple similarity metrics. The system contains a large library of ready to use, modern, statistical relationship models along with an interface to teach them from various language sources. The modularity of the visualization environment allows for quick insertion of new similarity measures to compare new corpus-based metrics against current state of the art.",,1

A Comprehensive and highly dynamic analytical User Interface Application is developed using a powerful UI library and framework named Dash in Python, that aims at providing detailed insights on worldwide terrorist attacks from the year 1970 to 2018. Dash framework allows a developer to build high level UI applications that contain extensively integrated user components to gain the benefits of maximum dynamicity from the application in the least possible time. Moreover, it is best and easy to use library to make good visualizations via time series plots (e.g., stacked area graph) and maps and helps in inclusion of effective UI components as it uses html, javascript and css internally. You can also create your own custom components using Javascript and React Js, so building a fast and robust UI application is a lot more easier with this framework.",,1
0,https://github.com/patelayush/Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Using-min-Binary-Heap.git,"IntroductionConsider a data communication network that must route data packets (email, MP3 files, or videofiles,  for example).  Such a network consists of routers connected by physical cables or links.  Arouter can act as a source, a destination, or a forwarder of data packets.  We can model a networkas a graph with each router corresponding to a vertex and the link or physical connection betweentwo routers corresponding to apair of directed edgesbetween the vertices.A  network  that  follows  the  OSPF  (Open  Shortest  Path  First)  protocol  routes  packets  usingDijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.  The criteria used to compute the weight corresponding to alink can include the time taken for data transmission, reliability of the link, transmission cost, andavailable  bandwidth.   Typically  each  router  has  a  complete  representation  of  the  network  graphand associated information available to it.For the purposes of this project, each link has associated with it the transmission time takenfor data to get from the vertex at one end to the vertex at the other end.  You will compute thebest path using the criterion of minimizing the total time taken for data to reach the destination.The shortest time path minimizes the sum of the transmission times of the links along the path.The network topology can change dynamically based on the state of the links and the routers.For example, a link may go down when the corresponding cable is cut, and a vertex may go downwhen the corresponding router crashes.  In addition to these transient changes, changes to a networkoccur when a link is added or removed.",,1

You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.  ## Working in the github/docs repository Here\'s some information that might be helpful while working on a Docs PR:  - [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine.  - [Content markup reference](/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) - All of our content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional enhancements.  - [Content style guide for GitHub Docs](/contributing/content-style-guide.md) - This guide covers GitHub-specific information about how we style our content and images. It also links to the resources we use for general style guidelines.  - [Reusables](/data/reusables/README.md) - We use reusables to help us keep content up to date. Instead of writing the same long string of information in several articles, we create a reusable, then call it from the individual articles.  - [Variables](/data/variables/README.md) - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.  - [Liquid](/contributing/liquid-helpers.md) - We use liquid helpers to create different versions of our content.  - [Scripts](/script/README.md) - The scripts directory is the home for all of the scripts you can run locally.  - [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it\'s also helpful to run them locally.  ## Reviewing We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.  :yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.   :yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.   :yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.    ### Self review You should always review your own PR first.  For content changes, make sure that you: - [ ] Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them). - [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy. - [ ] Review the entire pull request using the [localization checklist](contributing/localization-checklist.md). - [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide. - [ ] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct. - [ ] Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky. - [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they\'re all passing.  ### Pull request template When you open a pull request, you must fill out the ""Ready for review"" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.  ### Suggested changes We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.  As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).  ## Windows  This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:  1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\\r\\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\\r?\\n` instead of `\\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker. 1. Paths: Windows systems use `\\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either. 1. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it\'s generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.",,1
