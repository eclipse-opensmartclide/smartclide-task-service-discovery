The results are evaluated by precision and accuracy from the resulting confusion matrix for the four classes.  The other method used to classify a song from its lyrics is a Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis.  Four lexicons are hand-built from synonyms of the respective class words as seed words.  Additional seed words were added to a few classes in order to even out the counts of the synonyms for the four classes.  Point-wise Mutual Information was used to compare the similarity (1 is exact match, i.e. conscientious & respectable, -1 is two opposite words, i.e. day & night) each word in a song's lyrics to each synonym word in each class lexicon.

Among many genres of Bangla music; classical, folk, baul, modern music, Rabindra Sangeet, Nazrul Geeti, film music, rock music and fusion music has gained the highest popularity.

All the lyrics are stored in text format for further use. This dataset could be used for stylometric analysis such as authorship attribution, linguistic forensics, gender identification from textual data, Bangla music genre classification, vandalism detection, emotion classification etc. Identifying the significant research opportunities in this area, we have formalized this dataset which could be used for stylometric analysis.","bangla-song,bangla-text,stylometry,docs,bangla-nlp",3

Additional seed words were added to a few classes in order to even out the counts of the synonyms for the four classes.  Point-wise Mutual Information was used to compare the similarity (1 is exact match, i.e. conscientious & respectable, -1 is two opposite words, i.e. day & night) each word in a song's lyrics to each synonym word in each class lexicon.
