This book is about being agile and reducing time to market without breaking the bank. It is about designing something that you can scale incrementally without having to do a lot of rework and potentially disrupting your current state of the work.  So the key questions are: what does it take, how long does it take, and how much does it take to build your own IoT platform? Build Your Own IoT Platform answers these questions and provides you with step-by-step guidance on how to build your own IoT platform. The author bursts the bubble of IoT platforms and highlights what the core of an IoT platform looks like. There are must-haves and there are nice-to-haves; this book will distinguish the two and focus on how to build the must-haves.  Building your own IoT platform is not only the biggest cost saver, but also can be a satisfying learning experience, giving you control over your project.","iot-platform,open-source,node-red,mqtt,diy-solutions,books",22

This involves reviewing   of already existing software and learning website and derive requirements and   use cases based on the website primary features. The project also encompasses   construction of, sequence diagram, design class diagram, Collaboration diagrams   and other UML modeling diagrams based on the derived use cases. At the end,   high level planning is done for the whole project based on derived use cases by   Agile efforts estimation technique.  Scope   The project will consist of developing personnel scheduling software. Modules of   the website include a login feature, a schedule checker and a schedule planner.   Our innovative 100% web-based Scheduling & Open Shift Management (OSM)   product can help managers efficiently schedule their staff, and also lets the staff   help managers fill open shifts online, see schedules and changes, request time-  off, swap shifts, etc, etc. All schedules, changes, approvals, and alerts not only   happen online in real-time, but also are sent out as emails and text messages to   cell phones. Our Software can cut manager time wasted on scheduling tasks by   50% or more and let them get back to MANAGING! Introduction to HMSS  When workforce includes hundreds of employees, open shifts are inevitable.   Without the right skills-based workforce management tools in place, nurse managers   and staffing managers spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to fill scheduling   gaps. Not only is this inefficient, but it leads to increased costs and reduced employee   satisfaction.  Advantages of having online scheduling system  2.1.   ● Save Money  Reduce premium labor costs by leveraging the most cost-effective, qualified staff   to fill open shifts. Stop wasting time you don’t have on scheduling. Decrease the   time it takes you to create a weekly schedule for your team by over 75 percent   with HMSS.  ● Save Time  Save countless hours using instant communication strategies to fill open shifts.  ● Keep Workers Happy  Increase employee satisfaction by empowering them to choose when they want   to work based on experience, competencies, and skills.  ● Faster, Easier Scheduling  Healthcare staff scheduling has never been easier. Spend minutes instead of   hours organizing shifts for your nurses and other medical staff.  ● Monitor Attendance  Hospital Management System (Personal Scheduling System) – SWE 600 (Fall 2015) Prof.                               Instructors: Dr. R.   Riehle & Q Asghar   See which employees are coming in late or missing shifts. Send shift reminders   automatically to make sure everyone is on the same page.  ● Give Staff More Independence  Take some work off your own plate with collaborative healthcare staff   scheduling options. Allow your employees to request shift trades and swaps on   their own so you don’t have to micromanage them.  ● Avoid Human Error  Humans make mistakes, but HMSS doesn’t. If you forget to fill a shift or   overbook one, the software immediately notifies you of your error, allowing you   to rectify it right away.  ● Create Perfect Timesheets  Export perfect timesheets to create perfect attendance and work reports. Better   healthcare staff scheduling means easier payroll processing as well.  To deliver the best care possible to patients, we must begin with the best   possible workforce management solution for our staff. With HMSS, we help   control labor costs, minimize compliance risk, improve workforce productivity,   and deliver quality, cost-effective care. Here’s how:  • Physician coverage scheduling enables the effective and equitable deployment   of physicians and other clinician providers – your group, your rules, to build your   schedules  • Advanced staffing supports the safest and most appropriate assignment of   caregiver staff to patients, and balances workload distribution in the best   interests of patients and staff  • Intelligently forecast volume to build optimal schedules helps ensure proper   staff coverage for every shift, every day, across your entire organization  • On-demand visibility with labor analytics controls labor costs and allows   organizations to make evidence-based decisions  • Mobile management supports paperless workflow and employee self-service for   your on-the-go workforce",,5

Microservices architecture promises flexibility, scalability, and optimal use of compute resources. This lecture introduces the objectives that microservices are expected to realize and explains how microservices will do that. The lecture describes the key concepts – domain driven design, bounded context, events, statelessness and APIs. It discusses and demonstrates a real implementation of microservices using containers and Kubernetes.   Students will do a hands-on with the Kubernetes platform – learning about the container orchestration features that allow microservices to be deployed, scaled, configured, failed over, and upgraded to new versions while maintaining proper routing and load balancing. Students will learn how to make use of Kubernetes for running multiple interacting containers executing applications written in the technology of their choice.  The lectures discusses the service mesh and challenges with tracing and end to end monitoring. The relevance of events for decoupled collaboration is discussed and demonstrated. Concepts discussed include workflow choreography, the CQRS data(base) pattern for cross domain data sharing and serverless architecture. ",,4

A strong distinguishing characteristic of XSK, that also sets it apart from older Agile methodologies, is that it explicitly and strongly emphasizes software quality in general, code quality in particular, and continuous delivery is a must. What also sets XSK from Scrum specifically (and Scrumban depending on the kind of Scrumban that  you have) is the notable absence of sprints, where instead it follows a Kanban-style of managing and monitoring WIPs (work-in-progress tasks) for visualizing tasks on a daily-basis.  Moreover, XSK strongly promotes a culture of success built around a system of support and collaboration. To completely buy-in into the XSK Framework the entire organization and all of its people should embrace this cultural mindset of support and collaboration. What XSK wants to fulfill are: Effective communication and collaboration Workflow to easily manage tasks Guarantee timely deliverables Guarantee ABSOLUTE software quality Create a culture of genuinely supporting each other in the workplace (local and remote) To be more Agile than Scrum.",,3
