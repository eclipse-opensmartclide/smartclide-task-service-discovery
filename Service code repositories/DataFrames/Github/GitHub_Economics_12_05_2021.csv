0,https://github.com/microsoft/EconML.git,"ALICE (Automated Learning and Intelligence for Causation and Economics) is a Microsoft Research project aimed at applying Artificial Intelligence concepts to economic decision making. One of its  goals is to build a toolkit that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with econometrics in order to bring automation to complex causal inference problems. To date, the ALICE Python SDK (econml) implements orthogonal machine learning algorithms such as the double machine learning work of Chernozhukov et al. This toolkit is designed to measure the causal effect of some treatment variable(s) t on an outcome variable y, controlling for a set of features x.","machine-learning,economics,causal-inference,causality,econometrics,treatment-effects",1343

CoinMarketCap lists over 500 coins, and there are probably more. In this brief post, I offer Maxcoin’s qualifications as a worthy investment and trade currency.  Maxcoin has a dedicated, skilled, and cognizant foundation team that understands both the economics and politics of cryptocurrency. Crypto is not just a faster and cheaper payment method and a more secure store of value, it’s about decentralizing the use of currency by removing it from the establishment’s monopoly. Cryptocurrency allows you to buy and sell and give and save apart from state and bank run spy grids and theft rings. Because you own your coins which are transacted with high cryptography on a decentralized public blockchain, there are no extortionate fees, bank runs, frozen accounts, bailouts, or financial surveillance. The Maxcoin team understands the importance of using your coins in privacy and with security.  Our team members also have a various skill from their professional backgrounds in system administration, programming, web design, technical writing, project management, quality assurance, market trading, and others. More important is their enthusiastic entrepreneurship and dedication to expanding and enriching the Maxcoin ecosystem. Our team members spend countless unpaid hours of planning and building for Maxcoin. Learn more about our team here.  We believe Maxcoin has basic advantages that distinguish it from other altcoins. Here are a few:  Fundamentals  Stronger encryption (SHA3), faster transactions (1 minute block time), low inflation (16 coins per block) Budding Maxcoin Foundation with a roadmap to self-sustainability A one-of-a-kind Maxcoin Bounty Program that allows you to anonymously and immediately donate MAX and BTC to crowdsource the development of Maxcoin’s critical infrastructure and ecosystem Markets and Services  Listed on 7 exchanges including Cryptsy, Bittrex, Bittylicious, and BTER with 4 currency pairs Revolutionary Cryptobullion (startjoin.com/maxcoinbullion) that will soon be available from selected bullion dealers. Maxcoin can be spent anywhere Bitcoin is accepted through Coingateway.net Buy over 150 gift cards with Maxcoin (Pock.io) Maxcoin Gambling (Cryptobetfair.com) Integration into multicurrency wallet at Casheer.net, Oct 2015 Community and Exposure  Exposure to over 9,000 followers on twitter, more than Ripple, Darkcoin, NXT and many others with more market cap. Maxcoin Forums (forum.maxcoin.co.uk) and chat (maxchat.info) Other communication channels available at Facebook and Bitcointalk This list of distinguishing characteristics doesn’t change the market price overnight. Like many coins, Maxcoin has seen its share of malicious miners, speculative day traders,  and committed internet trolls. These people are either jealous of the above points or simply foolish and enjoy throwing away treasure. Yes, we are biased, but we genuinely think that Maxcoin is a bargain wonder coin. On the markets, it is at historic lows. But objectively, given its present facts and future goals, Maxcoin is at historic highs. | WHY MAXCOIN MAXCOIN IS MONEY WITHOUT BANKS. USING MAXCOIN, YOU CAN INSTANTLY, SECURELY AND FOR FREE SEND AND RECEIVE PAYMENTS TO FRIENDS, FAMILY AND MERCHANTS WORLDWIDE. A NEW APPROACH TO INNOVATION  MaxCoin is one of the most secure crypto currencies, both because it's based on next generation encryption, SHA3, but also because it's 'open source'. MaxCoin's software is open to inspection and improvement by the best security minds on the planet so that it's mathematically secure. If you don't like paying bank charges, if you don't like the way money is created by banks at no cost to them, and then loaned out to us with interest, then MaxCoin is paving the way to a new money. Open, transparent, and free of charge.

The execution fabric is fault tolerant by having all compute nodes participate in the job submission and handling process; work stealing is used to achieve efficient distributed load balancing. The fabric guarantees job execution and dependencies, and relies on an underlying scalable distributed storage system for inter-process communication (e.g. FusionFS). Data-aware scheduling maximizes data locality by scheduling computational tasks close to the data. Computations are overlapped with I/O to reduce wasted resources and hide latencies. The fabric is elastic, allowing it to grow and shrink in resource usage based on the application demand. The fabric also support compact task representation to alleviate task submission bottlenecks for common patterns (e.g. “for each x do y”). The execution fabric is integrated with several other projects, including FusionFS(a distributed file system), D^3 (direct distributed data-structure), and Swift (parallel programming system). The work will be evaluated with many applications (e.g. bioinformatics, medicine, pharmaceuticals, astronomy, physics, climate modeling, economics, and analytics) through the Swift project collaboration on the largest high-end computing (HEC) systems.",,4

282,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons.git,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors\' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so","aryia-behroziuan,artificial-intelligence,wikipedia,an-ann,neural-network,android,bootstrap,csharp,deep-learning,expressjs,firebase",3

In order for investors to utilize it, business analysts must understand the behaviors and attitudes of the public within the finance context.  Nowadays, social media perfectly tracked by data reflects the public emotions and sentiment about stock movement. Also, tremendous stock marketing news can be used to capture a trend of stock movement. The fundamental trading and decision making for main techniques rely on expert training and prediction. This article concentrated on tweets and stock news, and I applied sentiment analysis and machine learning models, especially, XGBoost to tweets and news extracted from Elon Musk tweets, Nasdaq and New York Times News about Tesla. Only by understanding the values and priorities of the public sentiment of Tesla stock will investors be able to make significant decisions.

Content: The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. However, these comparisons were primarily done outside of Delve and are thus somewhat suspect. The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases.  The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. `Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.  Dataset Naming The name for this dataset is simply boston. It has two prototasks: nox, in which the nitrous oxide level is to be predicted; and price, in which the median value of a home is to be predicted  Miscellaneous Details -Origin The origin of the boston housing data is Natural. -Usage This dataset may be used for Assessment. -Number of Cases The dataset contains a total of 506 cases. -Order The order of the cases is mysterious. -Variables There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are: CRIM - per capita crime rate by town ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

856,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/ai.git,"Artificial intelligence From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search ""AI"" redirects here. For other uses, see AI (disambiguation) and Artificial intelligence (disambiguation). Part of a series on Artificial intelligence Major goals[show] Approaches[show] Philosophy[show] History[show] Technology[show] Glossary[show] vte Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"".[4]  As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler\'s Theorem says ""AI is whatever hasn\'t been done yet.""[6] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7] having become a routine technology.[8] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[9] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[10] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.[11]  Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[12][13] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""),[14][15] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[13][16] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.[17] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. ""robotics"" or ""machine learning""),[18] the use of particular tools (""logic"" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[21][22][23] Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[17]  The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[18] General intelligence is among the field\'s long-term goals.[24] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.  The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"".[25] This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[30] Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[31][32] Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.[33]  In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.[34][16]",,1
