Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and alternative finance. In 2015, over US$34 billion was raised worldwide by crowdfunding. (From Wikipedia) The aim of the project: Create a web platform for starting fundraise projects in Egypt. The web app should include the following features: 1 - Authentication System: - Registration: - First name - Last name - Email - Password - Confirm password - Mobile phone [validated against Egyptian phone numbers] - Profile Picture - Activation Email after registration - Once the user register he should receive an email with the activation link. The user shouldn‚Äôt be able to login without activation. The activation link should expire after 24 hours.  - Login - The user should be able to login after activation using his email and password - Bonus: Allow users to login with facebook account - Forgot Password (Bonus) - The user should have an option to reset his password if he forgot it to receive a password reset link to his email  - User Profile, The user can view his profile which: - He can view his profile - He can view his projects - He can view his donations - He can edit all his data except for the email - He can have extra optional info other than the info he added while registration (Birthdate, facebook profile, country) - User can delete his account (Note that there must be a confirmation message before deleting) - Bonus: User must enter his password to delete his account  2 - Projects: - The user can create a project fund raise campaign which contains: - Title - Details - Category (from list of categories added previously by admins) - Multiple pictures - Total target (i.e 250000 EGP) - Multiple Tags - Set start/end time for the campaign - Users can view any project and donate to the total target - Users can add comments on the projects - Bonus: Comments can have replies - Users can report inappropriate projects - Users can report inappropriate comments - Users can rate the projects - Project creator can cancel the project if the donations are less than 25% of the target - Project page should show the overall average rating of the project - Project page should show the project pictures in a slider  - Project page should show 4 other similar projects based on project tags 3 - Homepage should contains the following: - A slider to show the highest five rated running projects to encourage users to donate - List of the latest 5 projects - List of latest 5 featured projects (which are selected by the admin) - A list of the categories. User can open each category to view its projects - Search bar that enables users to search projects by title or tag",,4

This CGM utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially perilous situations. The proposed CGM system makes use of Smartphone camera sensors to collect blood glucose concentration values from remote patients and then sends them either to a remote cloud server (where algorithm is stored, here the data is processed to produce a prognosis using previously stored values) to store information and execute rule based decisions (e.g., to warn a doctor when the patient‚Äôs blood glucose level is above or below a specific threshold) or to distributed fog computing nodes (e.g. Raspberry Pi). Fog Computing transfers the cloud computational and communication capabilities close to the sensor nodes in order to minimize latency, to distribute computational and storage resources, to enhance mobility and location awareness, and to ease network scalability while providing connectivity among devices in different physical environments. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with different potential stakeholders (e.g., patients, medical scientists, doctors and caretakers) of the healthcare ecosystem, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data in remote cloud server which is essentially a front-end that provides a web interface to remote users in order to allow them to access the stored information in a user-friendly way. This server also runs a back-end service that is responsible for sending notifications to remote users through SMS or instant messaging services.",,1
