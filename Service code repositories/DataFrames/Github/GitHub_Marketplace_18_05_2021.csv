ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版，适合windows操作系统，比如：Xp、win7、win8、win10系统。浏览器自带翻译插件和YouTube视频下载脚本，方便且实用。压缩包文件的格式是7z，如果解压出错，用7解压软件来解压（<a href=""https://sparanoid.com/lab/7z/"" rel=""nofollow"">7z解压软件下载地址</a>）。</p> <p><strong>注意</strong>：软件都是采用加密方式的，但为了更稳定、更安全的翻墙，建议卸载国产杀毒软件，至少翻墙时不要用它们！因为很多国产杀毒软件，比如360安全卫生、360杀毒软件、腾讯管家、金山卫士等不仅仅会起干扰作用，造成软件无法正常使用或速度变慢，它们与防火墙还有千丝万缕的关系!其实win10自带的defender就有杀毒的功能，如果还需要安全软件，可以用国外的杀毒软件<a

ipv6版、v2ray版、SSR版、赛风版、WuJie版、FreeGate版、SkyZip版,可以按照顺序依次尝试。由于国内网络环境不同、地区不同，封锁强度会不同，所以使用效果会有差别，有的地区几乎所有的软件都能使用，有的只能用几款，因此具体哪款软件适合你的网络环境，需要你自己来尝试。内存低于2G的电脑建议用<a

Support Dashboard Card Payments Quickstart Securely collect card information from your customers and create a card payment.  Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer’s browser, Stripe securely collects your customer’s payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe’s test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=""your-server-side-code"" method=""POST"">   <script     src=""https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"" class=""stripe-button""     data-key=""pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh""     data-amount=""999""     data-name=""Demo Site""     data-description=""Example charge""     data-image=""https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png""     data-locale=""auto"">   </script> </form> We’ve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key—only you can see this value. When you’re ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user’s ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=""true"" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user’s full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged—you must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you’d prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer’s payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge. This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass (e.g., metadata).  curl Ruby Python PHP Java Node Go .NET curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\    -u sk_test_fyzWf8eDyljIob76fMVSwIsi: \\    -d amount=999 \\    -d currency=usd \\    -d description=""Example charge"" \\    -d source=tok_6Pk6W3hFiGB7dyNavdvyrFkM These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of the source parameter.  Tokens can only be used once, and within a few minutes of creation. Using this approach, your customers need to re-enter their payment details each time they make a purchase. You can also save card details with Stripe for later use. Using this method, returning customers can quickly make a payment without providing their card details again.  Next steps Congrats! You can now accept card payments with Stripe using Checkout. You may now want to check out these resources:  Creating charges Getting paid Managing your Stripe account Supported payment methods Saving cards Questions? We\'re always happy to help with code or other questions you might have! Search our documentation, contact support, or connect with our sales team.

The achievements of online commerce has been so impacting that even established business houses have started out online promoting as a complementary work. However, first things always come first, and in case of internet commerce, it is mandatory to create an eCommerce website at the outset.

Choose Your Business Type As an eCommerce business owner, you can choose your business design as each your requirement. Either you can sell only throughout your online store, or, can sell your products on marketplaces like Amazon, FlipKart, eBay, and so forth You can also sell your products on both the programs each time. Choose a Company and Domain Once you have decided on your array of items and business model, the next step would be to choose a business name and create a domain. A business name should be relevant to your products and easy to remember for your target audience. A website gives an identity and makes it easier for online buyers to recognize you. However, for companies with limited financial resources, it would be desirable to get a shared domain. Sharing a domain with an established name makes it easier for calling your target customers.

In order to do this, you’ll need to set up your system so you can interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.  The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. You’ll learn how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.  You’ll have to gain an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements. 1: Interface with a stock price data feed Interface with a stock price data feed and set up your system for analysis of the data Financial Data Python Git Basic Programming  2: Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization React Typescript Web Applications  3: Display data visually for traders Use Perspective to create the chart for the trader’s dashboard Technical Communication Financial Analysis Web Applications""}",,3
