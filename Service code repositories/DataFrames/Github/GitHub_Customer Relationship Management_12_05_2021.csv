As per 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. So, it is very important to predict the users likely to churn from business relationship and the factors affecting the customer decisions.

The idea is to do the same thing, but with more impact in a personal space. The site is poised to be somewhat of a Facebook LinkedIn hybrid. The site is primarily focused to be a company internal CRM (customer relationship management) system; I call it an Employee Community Network (ECN). From the site, you can connect with other company employees, post about your interests, showcase your talents, and even see what internal jobs are open within the company with our ECN job board. The site showcases the hobbies and passions of employees throughout the organization and allows co-workers to find fellow employees that share similar interests. Not only does this bring the entire company closer together, it also opens up possibilities for better collaboration at work as workers begin to build report with one another across the organization and building close ties.

It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.” Masashi Kishimoto. Well, although that quote was made in the context of humans and our inherent capabilities, this thought can actually also be applied to anything that’s created by us. The more we learn, the better we apply. To build on that idea, let’s talk about one such small, albeit important, piece of creation – Customer Relationship Management, or simply CRM. The concept of CRM evolved from the 80s’ Rolodex devices, which were hailed for being the next-generation contact management tools at the time. After experiencing its highs and lows in the 90s and the beginning of the new millennia, CRM has grown and firmly rooted itself as an indispensable resource for businesses in the Information Age. But can it continue its run in the times to come? 1. Making sense of more and more data Most CRM software today have an efficient data collection tool embedded within themselves, which aims to recognize social patterns and make context-based decisions for the business. Markets are no longer influenced by businesses and corporate institutions; instead, it’s their entire customer base that has full control over each and every transaction. In the future, as big data becomes even more prominent, it’ll become extremely challenging for a business to analyze and make sense of the huge amount of customer data. CRM will have to build on analytical tools and make smarter decisions in order to serve a large customer base and keep them loyal. 2. Delivering a complete value package All businesses need to understand that their customers appreciate it when their queries and complaints are heard and resolved, and then some. The future of CRM has to be built on smarter data and trend analysis. Digging deeper and obtaining insight into their customers’ behavior will allow businesses to proactively create better product and service offerings, and address their needs more accurately. 3. A smarter CRM with a smarter AI As digital capabilities continue to grow, reliance on actual manpower becomes less prominent. This is essentially due to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to impart rationality to a machine and mirror the concept of ‘thought’ in them. In the same vein, as CRM becomes augmented with smarter AI, businesses are avoiding wasting precious time on the more monotonous and repetitive tasks. Along with this, the AI can make substantial studies on existing customer data and predict and deliver exact suggestions on sales and marketing activities. And it will constantly learn and re-calibrate itself to keep imparting more and more accuracy to these results, sans any human intervention. 4. Reaching business objectives efficiently At the end of the day, every business transaction is a value exchange between the company and its customer. And each business aims to maximize this value potential. Delivering an exceptional customer experience with CRM can greatly improve customer acquisition and loyalty rates, which can in turn exponentially increase the profit margins for the business. A more adept CRM can interpret market data and deliver better suggestions in a swift and productive manner.  As a CRM software keeps iterating and improving itself with the use of Artificial Intelligence, businesses can start to rely less on making uneducated decisions and come up with more meaningful strategies to engage with their customers organically. This not only fulfills the customers’ value requirements, but also makes the business more successful – a win-win situation for both the parties.""}",,2

[1] Accordingly, they are moving beyond managing clients as simple contacts to a whole new level of client relationship management, crafting a superior commercial client experience that gives the bank a competitive advantage and a more loyal, profitable and committed customers.[1][2] Bank Management System refers to systems that enable bank customers to access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a personal computer or other intelligent device. But most of these systems do not focus on how best to manage and keep their customer’s data more secured. The chances and threats that the sector symbolizes is no longer news to the present day banking sector.[4] No traditional bank would dare face investment analysts or new customers without a complete Banking Management strategy. The main intention behind the commencement of banking services is to provide the customers with an alternative that is more responsive and with less expensive options.[3] With options more secured, customers have more control than ever.[3] Their expectations are how safe and secured their personal information would be. They also want personal attention and highly customized products and services. Daffodil Bank Management System (DBMS) aims to provide critical information for managing the bank customers more effectively, and encourages other banks that already have similar systems to move beyond transactions to better customer management approach .",,2

It is broadly acknowledged and extensively applied to different fields, for example, telecommunications, banking and insurance, retail market, etc. In any business strategy, one of its main objectives is customer retention. For example, Vodafone should asses the customers’ activities (from their call logs) and hence predict the customers’ churn rate, so that a measure (a special incentive to customers) can be taken to retain them accordingly. The importance of this objective is obvious, given the fact that the cost for customer acquisition is much greater than the cost of customer retention (in some cases it is 20 times more expensive). Thus, tools to develop and apply customer retention models (churn models) are required and are essential Business Analytics applications.

Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget. The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. The dataset has data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.""}",,1

One of the key points at the start was in 1971, where Ray Tomlinson sent the very first email and his technology set the platform to allow people to send and receive files through different machines.[10] However, the more recognizable period as being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where the Archie search engine was created as an index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of computers was already big enough to store huge volumes of customer information. Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing, rather than a limited list broker.[11] These kinds of databases allowed companies to track customers\' information more effectively, thus transforming the relationship between buyer and seller. However, the manual process was not as efficient.  In the 1990s, the term Digital Marketing was first coined,.[12] With the debut of server/client architecture and the popularity of personal computers, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications became a significant factor in marketing technology.[citation needed] Fierce competition forced vendors to include more service into their software, for example, marketing, sales and service applications. Marketers were also able to own huge online customer data by eCRM software after the Internet was born. Companies could update the data of customer needs and obtain the priorities of their experience. This led to the first clickable banner ad being going live in 1994, which was the ""You Will"" campaign by AT&T and over the first four months of it going live, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad.

169,https://github.com/priyankvadaliya/Business-model-of-cloud-computing.git,"Enterprises usually store data in internal storage and install firewalls to protect against intruders to access the data. They also standardize data access procedures to prevent insiders to disclose the information without permission. In cloud computing, the data will be stored in storage provided by service providers. Service providers must have a viable way to protect their clients’ data, especially to prevent the data from disclosure by unauthorized insiders. Storing the data in encrypted form is a common method of information privacy protection. If a cloud system is responsible for both tasks on storage and encryption/decryption of data, the system administrators may simultaneously obtain encrypted data and decryption keys. This allows them to access information without authorization and thus poses a risk to information privacy. This study proposes a business model for cloud computing based on the concept of separating the encryption and decryption service from the storage service. Furthermore, the party responsible for the data storage system must not store data in plaintext, and the party responsible for data encryption and encryption must delete all data upon the computation on encryption or decryption is complete. A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) service is described in this project as an example to illustrate the proposed business model.","cloud-computing,encryption,decryption,php",1

This aspect of the marketing campaign is extremely important since it will tell to which part of the population should most likely receive the message of the marketing campaign.  2) Distribution channel to reach the customer's place: Implementing the most effective strategy in order to get the most out of this marketing campaign. What segment of the population should we address? Which instrument should we use to get our message out? (Ex: Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media Etc.)  3) Price: What is the best price to offer to potential clients? (In the case of the bank's marketing campaign this is not necessary since the main interest for the bank is for potential clients to open depost accounts in order to make the operative activities of the bank to keep on running.)  4) Promotional Strategy: This is the way the strategy is going to be implemented and how are potential clients going to be address. This should be the last part of the marketing campaign analysis since there has to be an indepth analysis of previous campaigns (If possible) in order to learn from previous mistakes and to determine how to make the marketing campaign much more effective.  ## What is a Term Deposit?  A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institurion offers with a fixed rate (often better than just opening deposit account) in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time. For more information with regards to Term Deposits please click on this link from Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp  ## Outline:  1. Import data from dataset and perform initial high-level analysis: look at the number of rows, look at the missing values, look at dataset columns and their values respective to the campaign outcome. 2. Clean the data: remove irrelevant columns, deal with missing and incorrect values, turn categorical columns into dummy variables. 3. Use machine learning techniques to predict the marketing campaign outcome and to find out factors, which affect the success of the campaign.   ## Dataset Link    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing  ## Dataset Information    The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.  There are four datasets: 1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014] 2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. 3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).  The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).    ## Attribute Information    Input variables: #### bank client data: 1-age (numeric)   2-job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')   3-marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed) 4-education(categorical:'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown') 5-default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   6-housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   7-loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')   #### related with the last contact of the current campaign: 8-contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')   9-month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')   10-day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')   11-duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.   #### other attributes: 12-campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)   13-pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)   14-previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)   15-poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')   #### social and economic context attributes 16-emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)   17-cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)   18-cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)   19-euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)   20-nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)    Output variable (desired target):   21-y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')     ## License  This dataset is public available for research.   Citations -   1.Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita.
