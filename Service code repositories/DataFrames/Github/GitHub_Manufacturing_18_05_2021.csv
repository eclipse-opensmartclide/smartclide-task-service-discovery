The primary aim of Pharmacy Management System is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock. Pharmacy Management system is useful to maintain correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in stock. It is used to manage most pharmacy related activities in the pharmacy.        Pharmacy Management System is a management system that is designed to improve accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user‚Äôs requirements. Using this pharmacy management system user is also able to generate report within a specified period of time. The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. The system will also give report showing the list of products expiry after a specified date before the product eventually expires. The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period. Pharmacy management system is being build. Pharmacy management system is robust, integrated technology. every month, the pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly. ",,12

At the end of the month based on the attendance. The object of any RFID system is to carry data in suitable transponders, generally known as tags, and to retrieve data, by machine-readable means, at a suitable time and place to satisfy particular application needs. Data within a tag may provide identification for an item in manufacture, goods in transit, a location, the identity of a vehicle, an animal or individual. By including additional data the prospect is provided for supporting applications through item specific information or instructions immediately available on reading the tag. When the student enters the classroom the card reader would be placed in front of the teacher and the student has to swipe the card and his In-Time would be marked, and when the student leaves the class his Out-Time would be marked. The students whose both In-Time and Out-Time is marked will only be considered as present. In this project we implement Automated Attendance Marking, Unit Test Result Generation, Centralized Library Automation, Automated Computer Labs, SMS Module , Report Generation. An Auto Generated mail would be sent to the principal, teachers, parents, students of school regarding the new or events, attendance, mark sheet, yearly magazine.

Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from Yahoo finance for year 2009 to 2019. There are multiple variables in the dataset ‚Äì date, open, high, low, volume. Adjusted close. The columns Open and Close represent the starting and final price at which the stock is traded on a day. High and Low represent the maximum, minimum price of the share for the day. The profit or loss calculation is usually determined by the closing price of a stock for the day, I used the adjusted closing price as the target variable. I downloaded data on the inflation rate, unemployment rate, Industrial Production Index, Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items and Real Gross Domestic Product as independent variables, Quarterly Financial Report: U.S. Corporations: Cash Dividends Charged to Retained Earnings All Manufacturing: All Nondurable Manufacturing: Chemicals: Pharmaceuticals and Medicines Industry, Producer Price Index by Industry: Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing, 30-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate, and Producer Price Index by Industry: Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing Index.  The independent variables are economic parameters which was obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website.  Methodology  1. Linear Regression: The linear regression model returns an equation that determines the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. I used linear regression tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year. The algorithm was trained with the historical data to see how the variables impact on the dependent variable. The test data was used to predict the adjusted closing price for the year and predicted a stock price of $193.38.  2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Support Vector Networks (SVN), are a popular set of supervised learning algorithms originally developed for classification (categorical target) problems and can be used for regression (numerical target) problems. SVMs are memory efficient and can address many predictor variables. This model finds the best equation of one predictor, a plane (two predictors) or a hyperplane (three or more predictors) that maximally separates the groups of records, based on a measure of distance into different groups based on the target variable. A kernel function provides the measure of distance that causes to records to be placed in the same or different groups and involves taking a function of the predictor variables to define the distance metric. I used the SVM tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year and predicted a stock price of $189.44.  3. Spline Model: The Spline Model tool was used because it provides the multivariate adaptive regression splines (or MARS) algorithm of Friedman. This statistical learning model self-determines which subset of fields best predict a target field of interest and can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between fields. I used the Spline tool in Alteryx with ARIMA tool to forecast the stock prices for the year and predicted a stock price of $201.84.  The results from the models was weighted by comparing the RMSE of each model. A lower RMSE indicates that the model‚Äôs predictions were closer to the actual values. However, a simpler model with the same RMSE as a more complex model is generally better, as simpler models are less likely to be overfit. Though the Spline model had a lower RMSE, the Linear Regression model had fewer variables. Thus, we combined the 3 models with the ARIMA forecast in a model ensemble, which allows us to use the results of multiple models. The forecasted stock price is $197.99 with 1.5% increase for 31st December 2019. Apart from economic parameters, stock price is affected by the news about the company and other factors like demonetization or merger/demerger of the companies. There are certain intangible factors which can often be impossible to predict beforehand hence the model predicts that the stock price of Amgen will continue to rise except there is a drastic downturn of the company.

In this project we implement the electronic BRICK SMASHER game which is based on real world BRICK SMASHER game on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) using Verilog HDL. Implementation in HDL (Hardware Description Language) is quite different from Implementation in sequential languages mainly because of the parallel nature of the HDLs, where sequential language code is executed by a digital core step by step, HDL code describes the functioning of a digital hardware, it is taken by synthesis tools that try to find a digital hardware implementation of the description, thus there is no step by step execution of the statement of HDL, and each statement is a smaller circuit in itself. The system is implemented on FPGA, which are modern programmable logic devices, i.e. we can program almost any digital function in it. Newer FPGA are capable of holding complete systems on them. They are called field programmable as they can be reprogrammed after manufacturing when they are in the field. They are sometimes called ‚Äòsea of gates‚Äô, as that is what they exactly are, they consist of millions CLB (Complex Logic Blocks) arranged in a matrix interconnected by a network of programmable fuses. Each CLB is capable of implementing 3-4 input logic functions through LUTs (Look-up Table) and Flip Flops, exact capabilities of the CLBs depend on the Architecture of particular FPGA family.",,3
0,https://github.com/swapnilmore1298/UltrasonicBoneDensitometer.git,"Osteoporosis means ""porous bone."" If a healthy bone is looked under a microscope, it will look like a honeycomb. In case of osteoporosis, the holes and spaces in the honey comb are much larger . This means bone has lost is density. As bones become less dense they tend to break easily, the bones of the spine are at great risk. The objectives of this project is to develop an ultrasound device to estimate bone mineral density (BMD). The device is  entirely self-contained, portable, and handheld, and permits real- time evaluation of the BMD by computing a parameter known as  net time delay (NTD). The NTD is defined as the difference between the transit time through the heel of an ultrasound signal and the transit time through a hypothetical object of equal thickness (to the heel) but containing soft tissue only. This parameter is sensitive primarily to the total amount (i.e., the average total thickness) of bone contained in the propagation path, and thus is  equivalent to the bone mineral content estimated by dual-energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanners, and to the (areal) BMD when  normalized by transducer area. Computer simulations of ultrasound propagation were used to study the relationship between NTD and BMD. The NTD and BMD were found to be very highly correlated (r = 0.99), demonstrating the high sensitivity of NTD to bone mass. The research described here, in conjunction with the fact that the devices are designed to be manufactured at very low cost, should enable the significant expansion of diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis.",,3

It is a prediction that the manufacturing industry is set to replace workers with modern technology across many sectors. TRS, a supplier of manufacturing staffing services has researched and reviewed the current engineering climate ‚Äì with its future.  There has always been a demand for skilled employees within manufacturing jobs, however, many are finding difficulty in securing a skilled staff force in an increasingly productivity driven workplace. Industry 4.0 is predicted to see manufacturers across the globe move toward new business models with data, cyber systems and cloud computing at its foundations. With technological advancement expanding across all engineering roles, there is a growing skepticism about the future of the engineering work force. However, research suggests that employment levels could thrive as staff could work in conjunction with new technologies instead of being replaced by them.  The US Manufacturing industry is predicted to have as many as 2.4 million jobs to fill between now and 2028. According to Operations Solutions, the lack of qualified talent in Manufacturing could be set to incur the collective loss of $454 billion in GDP by 2028. From a Manufacturing Recruitment Agency viewpoint, there are a variety of issues that are assisting this economic loss ‚Äì which are generally surrounding the perceptions of the future of Manufacturing.  The enhancement of technological advancements, according to Forbes, create misconceptions about the need for human staff in the near future. Workers have already been replaced by particular systems on the manufacturing line, with an ability to mimic repetitive processes at a faster and more accurate rate. This to many is a sign that traditional methods of production are being replaced by machinery. Although this appears a stressful concept, Forbes explain that this process has happened previously in history. ‚ÄúIn the mid-19th century, the machines of the Industrial Revolution were replacing traditional farming methods and changing the face of agriculture. But rather than see human staff pushed out, this, in fact, led to the creation of new job roles and skills ‚Äï from machinery operators to vehicle drivers.‚Äù This future Industrial enhancement will in fact open up the possibility of new job role opportunities as previous industrial development has, whilst improving overall site safety.  We can already see this new method of working within current production processes. WoodBusiness have explained that their open software solution ‚ÄúActiveAssist‚Äù actually enhances employee experience, using Identification systems to load required plans that are then projected onto the work surface. Machinery guides the employee through the workflow whilst tracking movements through 3D cameras to ensure steps are automatically updated when required.  The automotive sector is another example that employees at all levels ‚Äì mechanical engineering positions to sales and senior executives have the ability to collaborate with technology and have a more rewarding experience. According to Manufacturing.net, ‚ÄúAlfred P. Sloan Jr.‚Äôs commitment to new concepts such as automotive styling and Henry Ford‚Äôs introduction of the assembly line ‚Äì defines an industry in which change occurs more often than not.‚Äù The latest enhancement is said to be delivered by Industry 4.0, with the increasing demand for automation. This leads the way for more refined customer insight, as well as an increase in production therefore reducing the workload. Current automotive staffing increasingly offers more time to focus and use creative thinking.  Machines being used to benefit staff can also be applied in the concept of the demand and supply issue of skilled employees. Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute recently submitted their fourth skills gap study with reference to the future of manufacturing work. The study explains that ‚ÄúAs recently as August 2018, there were 508,000 open jobs in US manufacturing... While the job gains are positive indications that the industry continues to recover from the Recession and reflect strong production levels, it also means that finding talent with the right skills to fill the open jobs could reach crisis proportions.‚Äù Results show that maintaining production levels to satisfy customer demand is one of the biggest challenges arising in the next three years according to business executives. This is directly correlated with the difficulty in finding skilled workers who can complete their job accurately. ‚ÄúMany manufacturers today are turning toward automation to supplement the low-skilled jobs they cannot fill and instead focus their existing workers on jobs that are either higher skilled or require uniquely human skills.‚Äù One of the top skills predicted to be in significant demand is the concept of critical thinking. As the manufacturing process becomes increasingly automated, human skills such as this will be valued across Manufacturing.  The insecurity associated with Industry 4.0 will be short lived. As technology and automation evolves throughout Manufacturing we are seeing a change in how staff perform - not replacing staff, a development in their roles, and a demand for typically human skills on the rise. A human-machine pairing could offer an opportunity to close the skills gap and invent new roles available for workers that will deliver value.

The implementation of condition-based monitoring systems to reduce machine downtime caused due to unavoidable machine breakdowns is the most cardinal step toward the smart manufacturing process. Such unplanned downtimes of machines cause hefty production loss and increased maintenance costs.  Most of the breakdowns occur due to bearing failure or spindle misalignment due to wear and tear over time the service life of the motor. To predict the spindle failure various vibration analysis methodologies are present in the case to analyse the wear limit of the spindle through structural vibrations produced during the running condition. The objective of the article is to propose a vibration analysis of spindle using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) law and Artificial Intelligence models to predict the failure before wear limit of the spindle, thereby it will provide a self-maintenance capability to the machine, at a cheaper cost focusing on cutting fluids using smart sensors incorporated over Artificial Intelligence models & Machine Learning algorithm to predict the critical concentration of contamination of filtered oil used for grinding operation by various manufacturers.

ERP software integrates all facets of an operation ‚Äî including product planning, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing ‚Äî in a single database, application and user interface. ERP is an Enterprise Application for ERP packages ERP software is considered to be a type of enterprise packages, that is software designed to be used by larger businesses and often requires dedicated teams to customize and analyze the data and to handle upgrades and deployment. In contrast, Small business ERP applications are lightweight business management software solutions, often customized for a specific business industry or vertical.  ERP Software Modules Explained ERP software typically consists of multiple enterprise Automobiles modules that are individually purchased, based on what best meets the specific needs and technical capabilities of the organization. Each ERP module is focused on one area of business processes, such as product development or marketing. Some of the most common ERP modules include those for product planning, material purchasing, inventory control, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance and HR. A business will typically use a combination of different modules to manage back-office activities and tasks including the following: Distribution process management, supply chain management, services knowledge base, configure, prices, improve accuracy of financial data, facilitate better project planning, automate employee life-cycle, standardize critical business procedures, reduce redundant tasks, assess business needs, accounting and financial applications, lower purchasing costs, manage human resources and payroll.

Recommended Reading: The Difference Between CRM and ERP The basic goal of using an enterprise resource planning system is to provide one central repository for all information that is shared by all the various ERP facets to improve the flow of data across the organization. Enterprise ERP Trends The ERP field can be slow to change, but the last couple of years have unleashed forces which are fundamentally shifting the entire area. The following new and continuing trends affect enterprise ERP software: 1. Mobile ERP  Executives and employees want real-time access to information, regardless of where they are. It is expected that businesses will embrace mobile ERP for the reports, dashboards and to conduct key business processes. 2. Cloud ERP The cloud has been advancing steadily into the enterprise for some time, but many ERP users have been reluctant to place data cloud. Those reservations have gradually been evaporating, however, as the advantages of the cloud become apparent. 3. Social ERP There has been much hype around social media and how important ‚Äîor not ‚Äî it is to add to ERP systems. Certainly, vendors have been quick to seize the initiative, adding social media packages to their ERP systems with much fanfare. But some wonder if there is really much gain to be had by integrating social media with ERP. 4. Two-tier ERP Enterprises once attempted to build an all-encompassing ERP system to take care of every aspect of organizational systems. But some expensive failures have gradually brought about a change in strategy ‚Äì adopting two tiers of ERP. ERP Vendors Depending on your organization's size and needs there are a number of enterprise resource planning software vendors to choose from in the large enterprise, mid-market and the small business ERP market.

0,https://github.com/rodomenzain/AGROCOIN.git,"How this all started?  Our journey started 20 years ago with a business franchise, where we had been producing and supplying agricultural products with hydroponic technology.  Through years, we have successfully met the high standards of the agro-industry and achieved great goals with successfully established franchises in many countries. Our mission has always been to improve and learn new things.  And then, in September of 2017, we started to work on Agrocoin.  How Agrocoin is going to push agriculture business forward?  Agricultural industry is still a difficult business for new entrepreneurs. Huge investments in lands, quality maintenance of growing products, brutal competition between new and old companies\u200a‚Äî\u200aall of that makes such business an uneven playing field for fresh entrepreneurs.  In Agrocoin, we want to develop a stable and efficient worldwide agriculture ecosystem where anyone can participate.  Investors are entitled to be part of agriculture business with profit-sharing system for $AGRO holders. Customers will receive an option to purchase high-quality goods from any place simply by using $AGRO coin as payments. Growers can get access to sell point (only after successfully obtaining our Agrocoin Cannabis Certificate) in our established ecosystem. With our approach to work agriculture business will be an eye-catching industry.  Why we need blockchain?  Blockchain technologies are still a nonsense for majority, but there are 3 reasons why they will change habitual way in current business operations:  Transparency Traceability Decentralization With such technical side-shift we can put our operations on public and consistent network with very low chance data to be compromised.  This solution is providing comfortable sphere for stakeholders, suppliers, customers, companies and future observers.  Why we are working in Cannabis field?  According to the Statista, the legal cannabis market will be worth an estimated $24.1B in 2025, of which $13.2B will be for medical use. Mexico is the one of the best places for cannabis growing\u200a‚Äî\u200alarge tracts of land, labor, water and proximity to the market naturally. It is a solution to poverty in our country, that will generate new jobs and economic inflow.  Three Cannabis sub-markets‚Äî medicinal, industrial and recreational\u200a‚Äî\u200awill allow Mexico to be a world leader in the production of marijuana, being this plant endemic to our country.  Contrary to indoor production in the US and Canada where producing an average kilo of cannabis grown indoors is associated with 4600 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. In Mexico, producing Cannabis can be easily done with medium technology in a natural and organic way. #EnvironmentMatter  What are the next steps?  We want to start putting collection centers (Warehouses) in the main cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Culiacan, Cancun and Monterrey where we will pay to cannabis providers with $AGRO‚Äôs through the Agrocoin App (curently only Android) that allows real-time payment of $AGROs to the different producers, both large and small (of 20 plants per person, as mentioned by the proposal of Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero). Currently we have an area of 100 hectares with an installed capacity of 50  hectares for manufacturing. After Mexican Government will give cannabis a green light, we will start to produce it on our territory. Once we will select quality and we will destine it to the different markets that we already have in Canada and USA, making Agropot Oil (cannabis oil) to standardize its quality and be able to serve the different markets. We have the best certification in agricultural practices Primus GFS, which allows us to have the highest quality controls in safety and that are free of pesticides (the market requires it), so we will be training producers in plant management, flowering , pest control and environmentally friendly and innocuous techniques, since the market needs to be competitive to be competitive. After successful establishment of Cannabis + derivatives sales we are going to focus on strengthening our blockchain. Agrocoin blockchain must be mature because our net will be passing through enormous amount of data. By meaning of mature, we thinking about list of things: Instant Confirmations Network Security Nodes Enhanced Smart-Contracts Automated Blockchain Updgrading More on-chain data",,2

Note that the original design is crap, however, a debugged version is forthcoming from ""Uncle"" Robert ""The R.A.T."" Allen Turner.  CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009 has been updated to CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R1-03.09.2009 by R.A. Turner on May 21, 2019, just over ten years after the initial release of Version 1, Revision 0. Version 1, Revision 1 is Copyright (C) 2019 by the above mentioned parties and is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License on 21 May 2019.  =============================== DESCRIPTION: This project is an updated version of the ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"", a hardware MIDI Interface Card for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1,2 and 3, Dragon Data Dragon D32, D64 and D200, Tandy Data Products TDP-100, Tano Dragon 64 and other clones and compatibles. The original ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"" was designed by my nephew, ""Little John"", on March 8-9, 2009 as a learning excercise. He was teaching himself to use E.A.G.L.E. in order to design products for the TRS-80 Color Computer line of computers, with the help of his father, my brother, ""Big John"" or ""J.R."" as he is known to me. The ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"" was among his very first (learning the art of circuit design) works. It is a terrible design only because he knew nothing about circuit design at the time and it does not appear that his father, ""Big John"" (J.R.) offered any input in regards to this particular design.  I, ""Uncle"" Robert ""The R.A.T."" Allen Turner, have decided to polish up the design a bit and lay out a manufacturable Printed Circuit Board which I will release under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License. As such, I will analyze ""Little John\'s"" original design and then provide my improved version. The original ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"" design files, as provided by ""Little John"" and his father (J.R.) are contained in the ""Original (Deprecated)"" folder of this archive and should be referenced for this initial analysis of the design.  ================================ ANALYSIS OF ORIGINAL DESIGN: Load up the ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009.sch"" schematic file and have it handy for this discussion. Starting with Page 1 of the schematic, we see the expected cartridge (program pak) plug followed by an oddly interesting series of ""purported"" interrupts, labeled IRQ0* and IRQ1* (the ""*"" indicates low-level triggering, or active low). These ""Interrupts"", IRQ0* and IRQ1* appear to go, through disable jumpers, to Pins 1 and 2 of the CoCo Cartridge (Program PAK) Connector. This is both ODD and INTERESTING because Pins 1 and 2 of that connector are -12V and +12V, respectively, on ALL CoCo 1\'s, TDP-100\'s and ALL Multi-Pak Interfaces. Both of these pins  are +12V on the Dragon computers. Those self-same pins, however, are NOT connected to anything on ANY stock, unmodified, CoCo 2 or 3 computers. I am thus forced to draw the following conclusion: ""Little John"" apparently allowed for using Pins 1 and 2 of a CoCo 2 or 3 Cartridge Slot to connect to any desired interrupt within the CoCo 2 or 3. That is, a CoCo 2 or 3 might be modified to connect Pins 1 and/or 2 of the Cartridge Slot to any of the CPU Interrupts, the PIA Interrupt (CART*), G.I.M.E. (A.C.V.C.) Interrupts (CoCo 3 only), etcetera. This is an UNECCESSARY feature of the ""FlexiMIDI"" design and my initial inclination was to omit it from the design. However, since there are jumpers that allow these ""hacked in"" custom interrupts to be disabled (removed) via JP1 and/or JP2 or connected together (wire or\'ed) via JP3, I have decided to leave them in the design should anyone be so inclined as to use this custom interrupt scheme for experimentation or otherwise.  Also on Page 1 is a fairly standard RESET switch which I would imagine could prove to be quite convenient but potentially problematic if the device is plugged into a Multi-Pak Interface (RESET* is buffered in a single direction in the M.P.I. and should not be triggered from any cartridge plugged into the M.P.I.), Power ON L.E.D. (which I assume might be quite distracting) and some pull-up resistors for the interrupts, custom and legit. Lastly, there is a 220uF Electrolytic Capacitor for Vcc (+5V) filtering. Ideally, a low ESR Electrolytic should be used, however, paralleling a 220uF Electrolytic with a .1uF Ceramic Disc should provide approximately the same result as a single Low ESR type.  Moving on to Page 2, we see a crystal oscillator comprised of three inverters, three resistors and a crystal rated at 1 to 2 MHz. The third inverter actually acts as a buffer and ""shaper"". Schmitt Trigger inverters are used, although this is not actually necessary it does provide a nice, sharp square wave. Without the hysteresis provided by the schmitt triggers the waveform would appear quasi-sinusoidal at the crystal frequency if viewed on an oscilloscope, but would still function just fine. The output of that third inverter, the buffer stage, is fed into a pair of toggling D type Flip-Flops which provide a divide by two output and a divide by four output, either of which may be selected by jumper JP4. Ideally, we want a solid 500KHz squarewave as the ACIA Clock (which ""Little John"" labeled ""MIDICLOCK"" or ""MIDICLK""). If a 1MHz crystal is used we would place JP4 on Pins 1 and 2. With a 2MHz crystal we would connect JP4 Pins 2 and 3. This is flexible in that it allows the use of either a 1MHz or 2MHz crystal, whichever might be handy. In my case, and for the redesign, I have a large stock of 16MHz half-can oscillators and so this is what I will be using in the redesign. The 500KHz then, will be derived from the 16MHz oscillator by using the 16MHz to clock a binary counter. At the bottom left of Page 2, we also see three inverters used to invert A7, A4 and A3. This appears to be part of the ""address decoding"" scheme. Lastly, we see the decoupling capacitors for the inverters and ""d-flops"". This page (page 2) of the design is fairly solid and well designed.  Moving on to page 3, we see the ""heart"" of the ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"" MIDI Interface Pak. A 74LS133 13-Input NAND is used for address decoding. The 74LS133 in conjunction with the aforementioned inverters and the ACIA enable lines fully decode the ACIA into two consectutive memory addresses. With this, we can now decipher the addressing of the device. This will be done by writing A15 - A0 and filling in the ""bit status"" required to enable the ACIA, as follows: ========================================================================= | A15 A14 A13 A12 | A11 A10 A09 A08 | A07 A06 A05 A04 | A03 A02 A01 A00 | |=================|=================|=================|=================| |  1   1   1   1  |  1   1   1   1  |  0   1   1   0  |  0   1   1   x  | |=================|=================|=================|================== |        F        |        F        |        6        |        x        | ========================================================================= Looking at the above table and noting that A0 selects one of the two internal ACIA registers, it is clear that ""Little John"" mapped the ACIA to 0xFF66 and 0xFF67. This seems ODD because the most popular MIDI Packs designed for use with the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer decode the ACIA to 0xFF6E and 0xFF6F. A bit of research, however, led to the discovery that the original CoCo MIDI Pack, ""The Colorchestra"", mapped the ACIA at 0xFF66 and 0xFF67. The ""Colorchestra"" was released in 1985 by ""Color Horizons"" and I own two of them. The aforementioned ""research"" was simply me looking at the ""Colorchestra"" P.C.B. and deciphering the address decoding which turns out to be 0xFF66-67. I assume that ""Little John"" arrived at the 0xFF66-67 addressing in a similar manner as to that just mentioned. It would be relatively easy to redesign the ""FlexiMIDI"" to respond to both sets of addresses thus guaranteeing compatibility with everything. I have decided, however, that the redesign will feature a semi-programmable address decoder allowing the ACIA to be mapped to any two consecutive addresses within the 0xFF6n area. This will allow the ""Flexi-MIDI"" to be even more flexible. Setting the address decoder to respond to 0xFF66-67 will make the device ""Colorchestra"" compatible, whilst setting the decoder to respond to 0xFF6E-6F will make it compatible with the MIDI Interfaces produced by Speech Systems, MusicWare, Rulaford Research, Glenside CoCo Club and other CoCo MIDI Packs. As mentioned, it would be relatively easy to hardwire the decoder to respond to both the 0xFF66-67 and the 0xFF6E-6F address ranges, but I feel that this is unneccesary.  Next, we see the 6850 ACIA. This is the ""true heart"" of the device - a hardware serial port. Looking at the 6850 section of this page of the schematic, we see yet another oddly interesting Interrupt Selection circuit. It is in the form of a 2x4 Jumper Block. This appears to allow selection of any 1 of 4 interrupts to be triggered by the ACIA. IRQ0* and IRQ1* are the previously mentioned ""custom"" interrupts. NMI* is the 6809 or G.I.M.E./A.C.V.C. Non-Maskable Interrupt Input. The last interrupt on the 2x4 block is the CART* interrupt. This is actually the 6809 or G.I.M.E. IRQ* line that is passed through a PIA inside the CoCo/Dragon. This, the CART* interrupt is the one that should be used for compatibility.  The remaining circuitry on Page 3 are fairly standard circuits for MIDI IN, OUT and THROUGH. These go to 5-pin headers. It appears that ""Little John"" intended for MIDI Cable ends to be soldered to these headers. The redesign will feature 5-pin DIN MIDI connectors. I do see some potential problems with these MIDI IN, OUT and THRU connections on ""Little John\'s"" original design. The first problem that I notice is that the MIDI Ground Pins are connected to the same Ground (common or GND) as the computer and MIDI Pack circuitry. This is no good as it violates the MIDI specification and defeats the purpose of the opto-isolator. Thus, the redesign will sever the ground connection of the DIN connectors from the ground connection of the MIDI Interface Pak circuitry. Next, the 330 Ohm (330R) pull-up resistor connected to the output of the opto-isolator should probably be 270R, however, the device should work fine with the 330R resistor. The redesign will have this changed to 270R. The 10K resistor connected to the ""BASE"" of the opto-isolator darlington-transistor pair should not be needed. I will allow for it in the redesign for testing purposes. The output of the opto-isolator is sent through two schmitt trigger inverters before being applied to the ""Receive Data"" input of the ACIA. I am drawing the following conclusion in regards to those two inverters: It seems the design was originally intended for use with a Sharp PC-900 or PC-900V digital opto-isolator which has an internal schmitt trigger, the hysteresis of which provides nice, sharp waveform edges. It appears that ""Little John"" decided, instead, to use a 6N138 opto-isolator, which does not have hysteresis (schmitt triggering) and thus he must have included the two inverters to alleviate this perceived problem. I am relatively certain, however, that these two inverters are unneccessary and thus I will remove them in the redesign. Had I not used two of the inverters in the hex-inverter package for address decoding, I might have left these two inverters in the redesign, however, I decided the savings of one chip was worth eliminating these two inverters. Hopefully, results will be satisfactory. That is about it for the initial analysis of ""Little John\'s"" original design. I shall now proceed to design a slightly improved and, hopefully, manufacturable version of ""Little John\'s CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009"" Hardware M.I.D.I. Interface Pack. This redesign will be titled: ""CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R1-03.09.2009"".  ================================ THE REDESIGN: Load up the NEW design from the CURRENT folder in the archive and use it to follow this discussion. Starting with Page 1 of the schematic, I will start the redesign with the Cartridge Program Pak Slot Plug (Edge-Card or Edge-Fingers). This is what will actually plug into the cartridge port on the computer or Multi-Pak Interface (M.P.I.). Next, I will add an edge card socket wired in parallel to the edge-fingers. This is based on ""Little John\'s"" Universal Footprint which means that you can fit either a 40-pin card socket or a 40-pin header. This will allow an additional cartridge or other hardware to be plugged directly into the MIDI Interface, thus eliminating the need for a ""y-cable"" or Multi-Pak Interface. The +5V is filtered with a 220uF Electrolytic Capacitor in parallel with a .1uF Ceramic Disc or Dacron/Polyester/Mylar capacitor. A Power ON L.E.D. indicator is included here, along with an enable/disable jumper. Removing the jumper disables the Power ON L.E.D. should it become a distraction. Next, I\'ll add in the ""CUSTOM"" Interrupts, including their jumpers. The jumpers should be REMOVED from all of these if the device is to be used with a CoCo 1 and/or M.P.I. (Multi-Pak Interface) or with ANY of the CoCo Clones and/or compatibles, including the Dragon. In actuality, these jumpers should never be needed and thus should never be installed - they are for experimental purposes only. Removing the jumpers prevents the accidental application of +/-12V to the IRQ* output pin of the ACIA which would fry the ACIA. I have included 680R ""failsafe"" resistors, but it is likely that they would not prevent a fried ACIA. Lastly, I have included the RESET Switch for convenience. The RESET switch should NEVER be pressed if the device is inserted in a Multi-Pak Interface as you may blow the 74LS367 in the M.P.I. That is about it for Page 1 of the redesign.  Moving on to Page 2: This page is exclusively dedicated to the Baud Rate Generator for the ACIA. Starting at the left, we see the bypass capacitors for the 74LS590 counter. I have used both a 10uF Electrolytic and a .1uF (100nF) Ceramic Disc. This would be important for a ripple counter, however, the LS590 is a synchronous counter and so the Electrolytic could be omitted. I chose to leave it in. There is also a bypass capacitor for the 16MHz oscillator can. I created a dual-footprint for the oscillator can which allows the use of a full or half can oscillator. The 16MHz is fed into the LS590 counter which provides a choice of ten different clocks for the ACIA. For compatibility with existing standard MIDI packs for the CoCo, the 500KHz clock should be selected. The LS590 has an output register which is clocked by the same 16MHz that clocks the counter section. The enable pin of the oscillator is connected to system RESET* which prevents it from oscillating when the system is in a reset state. This pin could have been left floating causing the oscillator to always oscillate. It will work either way.  Page 3 is the semi-programmable address decoder. The 74LS133 in conjunction with the two inverters decodes 0xFF6n - the output will go low on any access to the 0xFF6x range. Only 12 of the 13 inputs to the LS133 were needed. The unused input could be connected to Vcc, E or RESET*. It is important to gate the E Clock in at some point and it could have been done here. I chose to connect the input to RESET*. The ACIA actually has an E Clock input which gates it with the E-Clock so it probably does not need to be gated to the address decoder, though, as you\'ll see, I gated the E-Clock into the next stage. The 74LS138 decodes 1 of 8 sets of even/odd addresses in the 0xFF6n range (it is enabled by the output of the LS133 and the E-Clock).) So, when any address in the 0xFF6n range appears on the address buss during the high time of the E-clock, the LS138 is enabled and decodes A1-A3 into 1-of-8 chip selects. For maximum compatibility, the 0xFF6E-F output should be selected.  Page 4: This is the 6850 ACIA. This should be either a 68B50 or a 63B50 or 63C50 for operation at up to 2MHz CPU Clocks. This should be pretty self-explanatory. The 6850 datasheet can fill in any necessary details.  Page 5: This is a fairly standard MIDI IN circuit. There are two optocouplers here: a 6N138 and a PC-900 - You should use ONLY ONE, not both. R9 is only needed if you use the 6N138. The diode is a 1N4148 or 1N914A.  Page 6: This is a fairly standard MIDI Out circuit.  Page 7: This is the final page and is a fairly standard MIDI Thru circuit. It simply echoes the MIDI In.  Well, that\'s about it for a redesign of ""Little John\'s"" original. I am ordering some prototype boards to see if this thing will work.  Updated to CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R2-12.29.2019 on December 29, 2019 - This minor update: A Universal 5-Pin DIN component was created and the GND Connection was reconnected to MIDI OUT and MIDI THRU. NO GND connection was made to MIDI IN. This should now create a proper MIDI Interface.",,2
0,https://github.com/concorde-speed/Concorde.git,"Date of Concorde In January of the year 1976 after 29 years of the first to penetrate to the speed of sound military aircraft jet - Two Concord took off together at the same time, one from London and one from Paris, the first airline service ultrasound for travelers. The aircraft Almottaghtan has looked towards the west as if they were Tgaraan - even Tsabakan - the sun. Where they arrived as if they did not Taathrca, in terms of time, in a new event launches air transport stage supersonic passenger wealthy people who do not allow them to narrow their time to stay in the air for long periods. How the project began and evolved, and how the outcome of the remaining Concorde lounges to museums ... This is what Santapah in the following lines: The emergence of the Concorde The deal ""supersonic"" between England and France was signed in 1962, for the design and construction of the first civilian supersonic plane manufactured by Airbus for them. After long years of arduous efforts and research strenuous, in addition to more than 5,000 hours in the air tunnels, proved to be a form of equity Almstrq with the body long cylinder for aircraft relatively large passengers, it is the best form executable command and control speeds ultrasound. The first two aircraft of this type making and Tjeribhma in 1969, and since then about 20 aircraft of this model, called the ""Concord"" was produced (the only civilian aircraft that exceed the speed of sound speed), and who serve in the British Airways and Air France in income 1976, the rate of seven aircraft of the British lines and five lines in French. The first fly line is the London - Singapore via Bahrain. In 1976 received Bahrain Airport very important event, which is to start regular flights between Bahrain and London, the fastest of the British Airways sound Concorde, the airport first and the only one who was receiving this type of aircraft in the Middle East, given that the Concorde need to Airports women with special specifications, so they need to take-off and landing runways longer than the regular airports runways, and the noise from the power of their engines leads to smash windows of buildings ordinary airports, and the speed has a crush Madarjha. What Concorde is distinct from other aircraft?Characterized by Concorde slim form in the form of a triangle (delta). And fly faster and higher than other aircraft altitudes, using the ""upward vortex"" method to accomplish extraordinary mission. For example, while the ""Boeing 747"" aircraft speed, better known as ""jumbo"" around 900 km / h (about 84.0 Mach) at an altitude of 35 thousand feet, the Concorde fly quickly 2172 km / h (Mach 2) at an altitude of 60 thousand Foot. It is known that Almaj is the real rate of speed compared to the speed of sound, and is equivalent to an average of 1225 kilometers per hour, so that the speed of sound changes with temperature change, which moves rapidly 1190 km / h at sea level, but it drops to 1060 km / h at an altitude of 36,000 feet above the ground, where the air temperature drops. Because the Place de la Concorde to fly faster than the speed of sound, they differ from the rest of the aircraft on several characteristics. First, in terms of the flow of the fuselage, where you need to own dynamic shape to face severe air resistance at these high speeds, and it is achieved by taking the body form of a high pin tapered, triangular wings tilted back, my head and a tail, and an introduction brushes can be moved to the bottom of takeoffs and landings to be able to see the pilot of the corridor, to the top during flight to improve the flow of the fuselage. Amounting to 83 feet and 8 inches tall plane wings in the company ""Oarossbesiak"" has produced and supplied surfaces work together Kdvh depth, also works differentially Kjnahat. There is no tip installed inside the concavity of the wing, but no spire parties descend and spin at the same time. The second difference is related engines, where the Concorde\'s engines proved directly in the wings to avoid the use of any parts of the conductive would crash at high speeds, and the engine fitted with a special friendly hotel to exploit the resulting exhaust for initial combustion cycle combustion again mixing with more new fuel to increase efficient engines and power, where this process provides the engine in the final stage of heating fuel for the production of the required additional power for takeoff and the transition from one phase to the heating of supersonic flight, allowing aircraft takeoff speed of 360 km / h. The useful load carried by the Concorde\'s less than a third of what was done other than in the weight of the jets under the sound, so it was no reduction in the efficiency of the engine, it is actually the difference between profit and loss. Every Concorde has supplied four-engine aircraft, ""Snecma Olympus DS 593,"" the momentum of 17259 kg. The company ""Rolls Royce"" design engines, which provided all Dagtin separate engine in order to fuel economy. Each engine and also provided additional Aq. Engine reverse payment system is also equipped. On the other hand, the Concorde is distinct from other aircraft fuel tanks and the presence of more and larger, with four engines burn a tremendous amount of kerosene has more than 25 thousand liters per flight hour. However, the fuel tanks lead a purpose whatever else, which is to maintain the equilibrium plane, where the center to raise the plane travels at high speeds for its center of gravity and then you move amounts of fuel between private additional tanks at the front of the plane and the rear to offset that effect, and returned those quantities at low speed in preparation for landing to bring the situation back to its origin. For example, a flight plan requires the distance between Paris and the French coast on the Atlantic equator at less than the speed of sound speed is determined to 0.93 Mach, to be at the height of about 9000 meters, after which the plane begins to jump quickly to reach the speed of take-off and altitude wanted, it performs speed between the two situations difference to a change in the dynamics of the plane to move from the airline less than the sound quickly to other higher speed of sound, and to overcome this situation, the transfer of fuel in an aircraft using a payment of reservoirs located in the introduction to the reservoirs in the system rear. During the transitional situation between the two modes of ex (between Mach 1 and Mach 1.6) increases air resistance sharply, and at this moment is to break the sound barrier. Once access to 1.7 Mach the captain to stop the internal combustion process, after more than a very plane speed of up to Mach 2, or 2200 km / h, more than twice the speed of sound, which represent the target aircraft speed, while the estimated target of 16000 and 18000 meters altitude. But when approaching landing, the fuel will move to the front of the plane, and the concomitant rise in the plane\'s nose, to land the plane in a scene it looks like a bird landing on the surface of the water. Finally remains the difference in the fuselage coating, where the Concorde is exposed at high speeds to a very large rise in body temperature as a result of increased friction of air molecules, so they coated special material properties and reflective stronger than those in the other aircraft, capable of dispersing such high temperatures . The fuselage itself is made from a special metal is characterized by a greater capacity to withstand the heat and stress resistance resulting from inflation fuselage resulting in turn from high temperature. The speed of the plane have been identified in the horizontal flight Mach 2.2, which is just before the thermal barrier (which is the speed at which if exceeded temperature increases dramatically), but it has identified the chronological age of the structure of 60,000 flight hours. And making the structure of the aluminum-alloy steel by thermal changes from -35 degrees to +120 degrees, as the flight above the speed limit of the plane requires that the structure is made with a mixture of steel and titanium, which means more weight. Fly the Concorde at the highest altitudes of 50,000 feet, where the air is equal to a tenth of what Tsawiyeh at sea density, and the temperature at that very low altitude, and despite all this work ultrasonic motors with high efficiency. According to reports of the pilots can handle the plane easily. The acceleration of the aircraft and transit speeds TransitionAnd what is characterized travel Balkounkord from other aircraft? Accommodate the Concorde for a hundred passengers and crew consists of a pilot and a flight engineer and his assistant in addition to the six hosts. When quitting, the passenger feels strongly pay back as a result of the launch aircraft from sleep to the speed of 362 km / h in just 30 seconds, which is called the Earth\'s gravitational force, and quickly reach the maximum height of the plane and penetrate the speed of the sound barrier. In all the flight times travelers can know the speed, through a private display panel installed in front of them, and are entitled to see the curve of the globe and Northern Lights because of the high altitude, which is flying the plane. Travelers can also watch the first layer colors of the atmosphere, where the height of the plane boundary between the first two Tbaktah. It takes Atlantic crossing Balkounkord three and a half hours only, while the that time about nine hours in the other underneath the aircraft sounds. And up the Concorde passengers who starts his journey from London at ten thirty in the morning to New York at nine thirty in the morning, before the date of its launch radios. This of course does not mean a retreat in time, but due to time differences and the short flight time! Over the last quarter-century, Concorde was the five weekly flights between Paris and New York in a record speed of less than 4 hours, at which time it cut the best of conventional aircraft, the same distance in 8 hours. He was landing at Kennedy Airport (according to US time) at eight in the morning, and exiting back to France at the eleventh hour before noon, where businessmen French used to negotiate with the Americans their customers at the airport Salons, without having to go to the business and financial district in Manhattan, and then return to Paris the same day.  And to what the fate of the Concorde? I tried both the US and Soviet governments (former) develop similar Balkounkord aircraft, but those attempts ended in retreat, either because the magnitude of the required expenditures on the American side, or the occurrence of accidents due to human error on the Soviet side. Some of these Soviet aircraft had stayed (model ""T U-144""), as amended to date, but used in air mail services, also placed some of them in museums, while one of them devoted to project Russian joint US. And remained the Concorde, solo travel of passengers faster than the speed of sound even temporarily suspended service to make adjustments after the accident led to an explosion killed one of them and all of them were. In addition, the high run that made the ticket price between Paris, London and New York round-trip $ 10,000, which led to limited use of the rich and famous costs, as well as what caused the noise and pollution, suffered Concorde most suffered from weak passenger demand for flights, in Following the incident, which came under the air France one in Paris in July 2000 to a near Charles de Gaulle airport hotels, which led to the deaths of 109 people on board and four people on the ground. Consequently After some major attended by experts and investigators, scientists, lawyers, artists, religious leaders and industrialists from different generations, between believers technology and Muslims in terms of authority to the modern age and among those who believe that it is necessary to rein in scientific progress and the development of ethical and legal controls him, took the final decision to stop flights Place de la Concorde. In July of 2003, tens of thousands of lovers of the Concorde gathered along the road to Heathrow Airport in the fog of London, the capital, in a bid farewell final before this model withdraw aircraft from service, after it made its first commercial flight in 1976. This has three Concorde planes reviewing the air before landing at Heathrow Airport in a reference to the termination of commercial flights known aircraft at supersonic speed. And charged the British Airways Concorde plane carrying 100 special guest at the final flight, which launched from Kennedy Airport in New York towards London, penetrated the sound barrier for the last time. Upon entering British airspace acceded Two Concord British Airways, one coming from the city of Edinburgh in Scotland, and the other from the Bay of Biscay west of France. Lovers plane Odalla in July of 2003 in Paris, as well as a pool, in the last trip out between Paris and New York, after a 27-year-old was cut where the distance between the two cities in a matter of three hours and a half. Where he lined up more than 250 workers from the maintenance workers bodyguards honor of the plane at Charles de Gaulle airport, with thousands of French gathered on the edge of the airport to see the plane taking off, holding a banner reading ""We love you, Concord."" The French lines: that the plane Concorde belong to the humanitarian aviation heritage and must therefore provide an opportunity for more people to see it, and added that it would apply to all of the fleet of Air France Concorde aircraft, which will be displayed every aircraft in museums in France, Germany and the United States, such as the Museum aviation and aerospace in the suburb of ""Le Bourget"" Paris, the Museum of Aviation near the Scottish capital ""Edinburgh"". Parts of the plane crashed as sold at Christie\'s for souvenirs to those who died to travel out, varied between the nose of the plane and the door of cabin leadership and a seat pilot and antenna radar warning in which the two motors of the engines and parts of the dashboard to the instructions and cutlery dishwasher ceramic spoons and silver booklet, worth total amounted to 3.29 million euros, went in favor of a charitable institution of the air France is working in the field of care for the poor children. Last auction for the sale of pieces of a British Airways Concorde has also been established. The British and French companies have announced at the beginning of the month of April of the same year 2003, he stopped Concorde flights after the company ""Airbus"" that produced externa announced: What\'s next in the field of transport ultrasonic? American company, ""Boeing"" is currently working on the supersonic jet, is supposed to be placed in service during the coming years, while filling the attention of European rival, ""Airbus"" accomplish its flagship aircraft, ""Airbus A380 (superjumbo) capable of carrying about 800 passengers, which had been achieved in 2007, while scientists tried to Japanese to develop a model of the plane was enable fly twice as fast as the Concorde, but their experience after the plane landed long model briefly after take-off from the site ""Woomera"" to launch rockets in the desert south of Australia, and it failed within the project included my company, ""Mitsubishi heavy Industries"" and ""Nissan Motor."" He held this paradigm of a length of 11 meters on a rocket, Plans for him to be separated from the booster rocket above the ground, and falling faster than twice the speed of sound, but it got out of control since it was launched. It was supposed to reach the aircraft remotely piloted altitude of 20 thousand meters, before Taud.aly ground faster than twice the speed of sound. The goal was to become a plane ""NeXT 1"" transport aircraft the fastest in the world to succeed Concorde, with the difference that it will be less noise and damaging to the environment and can accommodate up to 300 passengers: Thus crossed another Concorde SST recent trip mounted aboard a ship in the River Thames sailing from London to the Museum of Flight in Edinburgh, after he has made more than eight thousand flight during which 22 thousand and 768 hours and 56 cut-minute flight, the folded thereby separating mythic unique and important commercial aviation history, a supersonic flight, waiting for what the future holds for us of new inventions ?!",,2

Finally, we provide benchmarking instances, CPLEX codes, and genetic algorithm codes, in order to promote related-research, thus expediting the adoption of energy-efficient scheduling in manufacturing facilities.

The firm specialises in the entire array of building wires that are certified by ISO 9001:2008 standards. Human life has reached high levels of complexity. Today, we are surrounded by gadgets of all kinds to perform the basin functions for us. From the mobile phone to the night lamp that we switch off before going to bed, these gadgets have become intricately entangled with our daily activities. Yet, we tend to forget the importance of electricity in ensuring the smooth functioning of these gadgets. And we tend to underestimate the importance of selecting quality wiring harness manufacturers to complete the electrical infrastructure for our homes.  The building wires and cables that connects our homes and business is perhaps the most crucial component of the electrical system. The brick and concrete makes up the skeleton of the building and the furnishings provide the decoration and aesthetic appeal. But it is the wires that bring life. Improper wiring or procuring low quality building wires can lead to disastrous circumstances. Hence, investing in the right brand of control cables is crucial in ensuring the safety and well being of your home or business.  The primary function that wires perform is provide a circuit for your electrical appliances. As a result, the conductivity of the wire, or its efficiency in helping the flow of electrons is a particularly important criterion while selecting wires. Poor quality wiring can lead to unwanted heating, thereby leading to significant losses and higher power bills. Besides, building wires also need to have a proper insulating cover to prevent short circuiting and accidental fires. Understanding these aspects of your wires can help you make the correct choice during purchase.   The wiring installed in any house or business establishment is a single time investment. Unlike the furnishings or paints that can be changed at will, electrical wirings are seldom replaced. Therefore, employing the best available option for your requirements is crucial.  'Rajdoot' Cables, established in 1990, has an exhaustive line of high quality wires that are manufactured using advanced technology and the best quality materials. The company boasts of a long range of products such as Building Wires, Control Cables, Switch Board Cables, Single and Multi Core Cables, Fire Performance Cables, PVC Conduit Pipes, Wiring Harness, Aluminum Armoured Cables and Aluminium Unarmored Cables.

Furthermore, these approaches combined together constitute a hybrid systems providing a 3D reconstruction and NDT analysis. These systems, however, suffer from drawback such as errors during the data fusion and higher cost for manufacturers. In an attempt to solve those problems, a single active thermography system based on Scanning-From-Heating (SFH) is proposed in this paper. Besides 3D digitization of the object, our contributions are twofold: (i) the non-through defect detection for homogeneous metallic object and (ii) fiber orientation assessment for long fiber composite material. The experiments on steel and aluminum plates show that our method achieves to detect non-through defects. Additionally, the estimation of the fiber orientation is evaluated on carbon-fiber composite material.",,1

0,https://github.com/berkcan1992/Process-Design-Optimization-under-Uncertainty.git,"{""This paper develops a computational framework to optimize the process parameters such that the bond quality between extruded polymer filaments is maximized in fused filament fabrication (FFF). A one-dimensional heat transfer analysis providing an estimate of the temperature profile of the filaments is coupled with a sintering neck growth model to assess the bond quality that occurs at the interfaces between adjacent filaments. Predicting the variability in the FFF process is essential for achieving proactive quality control of the manufactured part; however, the models used to predict the variability are affected by assumptions and approximations. This paper systematically quantifies the uncertainty in the bond quality model prediction due to various sources of uncertainty, both aleatory and epistemic, and includes the uncertainty in the process parameter optimization. Variance-based sensitivity analysis based on Sobol' indices is used to quantify the relative contributions of the different uncertainty sources to the uncertainty in the bond quality. A Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model is constructed to compute and include the model error within the optimization. Physical experiments are conducted to show that the proposed formulation for process parameter optimization under uncertainty results in high bond quality between adjoining filaments of the FFF product.""}",,1

Around 80,000 new products are created and need to be tested for their time of effect (which is measured as the time taken for the drug to completely cure the pain), as well as the quality assurance (which tells you whether the drug was able to do a satisfactory job or not).     Question 1:  The quality assurance checks on the previous batches of drugs found that ‚Äî it is 4 times more likely that a drug is able to produce a satisfactory result than not.  Given a small sample of 10 drugs, you are required to find the theoretical probability that at most, 3 drugs are not able to do a satisfactory job.     a.) Propose the type of probability distribution that would accurately portray the above scenario, and list out the three conditions that this distribution follows.  b.)  Calculate the required probability.      Question 2:  For the effectiveness test, a sample of 100 drugs was taken. The mean time of effect was 207 seconds, with the standard deviation coming to 65 seconds. Using this information, you are required to estimate the range in which the population mean might lie ‚Äî with a 95% confidence level.     a.)Discuss the main methodology using which you will approach this problem. State all the properties of the required method. Limit your answer to 150 words.  b.)Find the required range.     Question 3:  a) The painkiller drug needs to have a time of effect of at most 200 seconds to be considered as having done a satisfactory job. Given the same sample data (size, mean, and standard deviation) of the previous question, test the claim that the newer batch produces a satisfactory result and passes the quality assurance test. Utilize 2 hypothesis testing methods to make your decision. Take the significance level at 5 %. Clearly specify the hypotheses, the calculated test statistics, and the final decision that should be made for each method.     b) You know that two types of errors can occur during hypothesis testing ‚Äî namely Type-I and Type-II errors ‚Äî whose probabilities are denoted by Œ± and Œ≤ respectively. For the current sample conditions (sample size, mean, and standard deviation), the value of Œ± and Œ≤ come out to be 0.05 and 0.45 respectively.    Now, a different sampling procedure(with different sample size, mean, and standard deviation) is proposed so that when the same hypothesis test is conducted, the values of Œ± and Œ≤ are controlled at 0.15 each. Explain under what conditions would either method be more preferred than the other, i.e. give an example of a situation where conducting a hypothesis test having Œ± and Œ≤ as 0.05 and 0.45 respectively would be preferred over having them both at 0.15. Similarly, give an example for the reverse scenario - a situation where conducting the hypothesis test with both Œ± and Œ≤ values fixed at 0.15 would be preferred over having them at 0.05 and 0.45 respectively. Also, provide suitable reasons for your choice(Assume that only the values of Œ± and Œ≤ as mentioned above are provided to you and no other information is available).     Question 4:     Now, once the batch has passed all the quality tests and is ready to be launched in the market, the marketing team needs to plan an effective online ad campaign to attract new customers. Two taglines were proposed for the campaign, and the team is currently divided on which option to use.  Explain why and how A/B testing can be used to decide which option is more effective. Give a stepwise procedure for the test that needs to be conducted. ",,1

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.  The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.  In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where, given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has any tour shorter than L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.  The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, a large number of heuristics and exact algorithms are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.[1]  The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources will want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.",,1

This machine can be used for Cutting, Engraving and Marking on wood, acrylic and PCB objects.   Robotic Arm has not been developed so that they are imported directly from another country. This has an impact on the industry that is difficult to develop because of the price of Robotic Arm still expensive. The challenge is how to make Robotic Arm with good performance but low cost so that it can contribute to the acceleration of domestic manufacture industry.  The software portion of a computer numerical control system must consist of at least of three major programs: a part program, a service program, and a control program. The part program contains the geometry description of the part being produced and the cutting conditions such as spindle speed and federate.  Design picture that has been made on the PC sent to the microcontroller using serial communication then Robotic Arm perform an execution on an object according to point coordinates. Drill spindles will create patterns on objects automatically according to the design drawings. After testing, the Robotic Arm can be used for cutting, engraving and marking on wood, acrylic, and PCB to 2D objects with 96% of carving accuracy and 100% of depth accuracy. This machine works on an object with a maximum size of 28cm x 21cm.

FDA CBM approves any drug given to any sick animal, it includes food producing animals, pet animals like dogs, cat, horses including ornamental fish.   Main tasks of the Centre for Veterinary Medicines are: Evaluate animal drugs to make sure that they are safe and effective prior to entering the market place Ensuring that animal drugs are safe for humans who might consume food derived from those animals for the animals themselves for the environment Ensure that the drug is effective for its intended purposes  Evaluation of Products: The process involves working with the pharmaceutical sponsor to develop what requirements will be necessary to demonstrate that a product is safe and effective Working on the technical sections of the medicine to make sure that each of the components are safe & effective for the target animal Also working on the safety and effectiveness of the manufacturing chemicals and its effect on the environment Ensuring the human food safety of the medicines which composes of toxicology residue chemistry and microbial safety  Steps through applying to approval of a trail drug:  For a sponsor to get approval of a trail drug, the application goes through the below steps in rounds till it is approved or till successful.  There will be an initial engagement stage - It's generally a pre-submission conference in which the sponsor will educate the center on the various characteristics and aspects of their particular drug product through a dialogue Next step is for extra information query The center comes back with the additional requirements for the study The extra information and questions that they need from the supplier Also they can suggest a few steps that would help successfully demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for approval Result communication from the approval Centre The result is generally communicated through different ways It includes the conditions of use of the medicine The label for the drug, i.e., information to the end user of how to properly use the drug and the conditions under which it will be safe and effective Publishing freedom of information summary - The approval Center outlines the particular studies and information that was looked at and the conclusions drawn through the process of evaluation Updating online and ensuring availability of the result on a searchable database on in FDA CBM website Farmers and animal owners need to have remedies to relieve suffering and death in their animals and hence importance of safe & effective labeling of drugs is stressed  Problems faced during approval of Veterinary Drugs: Rule requires that a covered entity or a business associate will provide notice of a breach to a covered entity.

Example dogs have a product approved, based on tests on boxers and spaniels and when the drug is out pugs don't react as well and changes in drug level is done based on animal weight Continuous lookout for antimicrobial resistance in animals. When an animal is infected by resistant bacteria the treating veterinarian turns to more expensive or even more toxic antimicrobials to try to clear the infection Continuous monitoring of the dangers of drugs to animal intended for the food supply as bacteria/resistant bacteria can be transmitted through the food supply and cause disease in humans Constant surveillance of resistance to drugs by animals intended for human consumption, taking intervention to try to limit/contain resistance, monitoring and estimating how big an impact an intervention had and whether it really had the intended consequences Compliance department has to workup all types of compliance actions. The USDA inspects all animals that come through slaughter plants and a number of different sampling strategies are taken and tested to ensure that animal drugs monitored are approved ones and are in levels that are above accepted tolerance levels Sending inspectors to the actual farm and testing animals when drug is found in a higher quantity than approved, and taking appropriate action when and if so Ensuring different levels of follow up is undertaken when an issue is found, starting from verbal, followed up with an official warning letter moving to seizure or an injunction and as a last step they will be liable to prosecution Ensuring and constantly checking the quality of meat imported into the country from other places where the checks might not be so stringent Constant international collaboration to regulate and for an acceptable standard of chemicals introduced into animal drugs and their feed Keeping up-to-date with the genetically modified animals and their effect on humans during consumption""}",,1

Action 1: How to onboard a brand-new advertising project Whether you are beginning a new marketing campaign from square one or you are inheriting an existing advertising campaign, it is really important to recognize 2 things. # 1 You require to develop your advertising goals. Now usually we have clients that will certainly claim their objective is to obtain more sales. Yet that is an extremely high-level goal.

And also honestly, you wish to be as sensible as possible because that\'s the accountable thing to do as a great online marketer. A lot of people strive for the over night success desire, however the fact is excellent marketing can require time. Now that you have established you require to establish some advertising goals and also a spending plan, after that you can transfer to tip number two, which is ""just how to structure your advertising strategy."" Action 2: Exactly how to structure your advertising plan The first thing we suggest that you do is to develop an advertising and marketing channel, or really plainly recognize the advertising and marketing channel that already exists. If your business is already generating any type of sales, after that you likely have an advertising and marketing channel whether you understand it or not. It is necessary to recognize which part of the funnel you will certainly need to influence with your advertising project. Understanding the advertising channel will help you pinpoint which stage of the channel demands adjustments. To get a far better understanding of the advertising and marketing channel, let\'s take a more detailed look at an advertising funnel as well as break down an advertising funnel for B2C (service to customer) as well as B2B (organization to service) firms. At the top of the channel you have the recognition stage. For both B2B or B2C companies this is where potential consumers become aware of your company either by means of search, or an advertisement, or a person referring them to you. The next part of the channel is the interest stage. This is where your capacity clients start to read more concerning your product and services. After that phase of the channel is the consideration stage. This is where your capacity customers actually begin thinking about buying your products. They might begin to review your evaluations or compare your products to others that are on the market. After the consideration stage is the intent phase. This is the stage where the potential client prepares to buy as well as simply needs a little push to complete the transaction. If you\'re a B2C firm, that implies that a visitor has perhaps added something to their cart. And also if you\'re a B2B firm, that implies that a site visitor may have asked for a meeting or a live trial. Swiftly after that, the prospective consumer enters the examination stage. This is when the potential consumer is considering the experience they are having as they are having a look at for a B2C company or finishing the contract for a B2B firm. At the really bottom of the channel you have the actual purchase, which is when the potential client becomes a real consumer. As you can see, there is a whole process to getting a client to really end up being a client. On top of that, a channel can continue after the acquisition factor, particularly if you wish to get even more sales from your present consumers. However those phases we pointed out are mosting likely to be the major locations that the majority of marketing managers require to focus on. Nevertheless, if you wish to discover a bit a lot more concerning marketing funnels, check out this blog where we go a lot more thorough with the advertising and marketing channel phases. As you are doing your marketing administration, you wish to begin asking on your own, ""Which stage in the advertising and marketing channel does my organization require the most assist with?"" You will discover that some business require general understanding prior to they can enhance any other part of their funnel. You may additionally locate that some business have a lot of awareness, yet battle to convert those introduce sales. However, once you recognize where your marketing needs one of the most aid, then you can concentrate there and also start to establish those leading indication objectives. For example, in the recognition stage, you have to focus on getting to a great deal of people. And also if business spending plan you have actually established is reduced, that suggests you will likely require to make use of an organic advertising and marketing approach. Currently let\'s move on to tip number three, which is just how to establish your advertising and marketing projects Action 3: How to set up your marketing campaigns. The first thing you need to think of below is production. What we indicate by ""production"" is you need to understand WHO or WHAT you require and WHEN you require it. To figure this out, go back to your leading indications and think about just how you are mosting likely to complete them. Possibly you need a web content writer, a designer, or a marketing spending plan. Or perhaps you require to set aside a couple of hours a day, to hire an agency, or a few other tools to aid you be reliable.

Since doesn\'t mean you are seeking that delayed indication or that major result that you wish to accomplish. Rather, you\'ll want to track whether or not your growth is headed in a positive instructions. Ideally, it\'s very easy to determine a trend line that is going up overtime. For example, if you are publishing on YouTube on a daily basis for six months as well as you are not obtaining any kind of sights whatsoever, then that is an indication that you require to quit and reassess your advertising strategy. One of our company\'s favorite tools to make use of to track development is Google Analytics. It\'s very simple to set up on your own as well as ought to take you no time to obtain arrangement and start. As soon as you\'re set up for success with Google Analytics, you can go on to tip number four, which isn\'t truly an action however it is a crucial idea to live by. Step 4: Stay with your strategy We have actually stated it before however excellent advertising takes some time. We can\'t emphasize this sufficient.

Bear in mind to still be tracking your outcomes and making sure you\'re constructing some energy or seeing a positive trend line. Even if the positive trend line is slow, it is still positive. Now allow\'s go on to our last step. Tip 5: Reporting If you are doing any type of type of advertising and marketing management or if you are an advertising and marketing supervisor on your own, after that at some time you will require to do some reporting. Whether you are reporting to yourself, stakeholders, a supervisor, or a customer, this is an area where you require to successfully interact just how your advertising and marketing is going.
