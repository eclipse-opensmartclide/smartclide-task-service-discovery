However, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality. I believe this can be changed once a common medium is found. Through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free. This can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph. Through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money. As there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the user‚Äôs favorite restaurant, cinema hall, etc. We can also offer him stock/mutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage him/her to do more with the data. This information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with. We can also make mock pitches that contain information post-investment, mutual funds, and its effect on his savings account, etc. This helps in finding potential customers for the bank. All the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investments/savings will be at his discretion. No such service is available right now.    2)      It is simple, fast, and efficient from both the user and the vendor's point of view. Imagine being able to scan a QR on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet.

333,https://github.com/SawanKumarJindal/Sampling-Crossing-Free-Spanning-Trees.git,"Spanning trees are one of the most important problems in theoretical science today. They can be seen as path finding algorithms which minimizes the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, automatic speech recognition, etc. In this project, we are analyzing geometric graphs and finding about the spanning trees with a special property of crossing-free nature, in them. We are using Markov Chain algorithms to sample random spanning trees. In this project we are working with complete graphs and assuming that the points are in general position (that is, there are no three or more collinear points). We are analyzing crossing-free spanning trees in such graphs. Geometrical graphs are the graphs in which vertices are defined by set of points. In particular, we are aiming to generate a random crossing-free spanning tree, as well as to count all such spanning trees for a given graph. Crossing-free structures have been investigated by the computational geometry community for decades. However, almost all of the developed (deterministic) algorithms counting these structures run in exponential time. There are a lot of approaches for finding a crossing ‚Äì free spanning tree. One simple approach to find a crossing free spanning tree would be to take a vertex, and draw line segments from that vertex to every other vertex in the graph. We are using another approach to generate crossing-free spanning tree as it will help us better with our next steps. The proof of the crossing-free nature, the spanning tree property and its authenticity are included in the later sections. After generating crossing free spanning tree, we are experimenting with probabilistic Markov Chain algorithms to see if we can achieve close approximation of the answer (count of all crossing free spanning trees) in polynomial time. We have used this project to generate the crossing free spanning trees experimenting with a graph containing 5 vertices and after successful execution; we are able to generate 77 crossing free spanning trees. We tried 9200 Markov Chain steps per sample and after 378 numbers of iterations (coupon collector value), we are able to reach all states.",,2
