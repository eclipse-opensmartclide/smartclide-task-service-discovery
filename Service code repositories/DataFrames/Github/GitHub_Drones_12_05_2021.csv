Early Detection of Disease helps in increasing the crop productivity as well as in minimizing expense. Technical approaches using machine learning and computer vision are actively researched to achieve intelligence farming by early detection on plant disease. The accuracy of object detection and recognition systems has been drastically improved by the recent development in Deep Neural Networks. By using these systems and implementation of computer vision and machine learning techniques, plant diseases can be detected. Here we have used transfer learning based approach to diagnose diseases of different plants using its images captured by camera devices either drone or smartphone. Our goal is to build a market oriented product for Plant Disease Detection, a smartphone app compatible with both smartphone camera and drone camera.

Basically this is setup for the AutoQuad (www.autoquad.org) flightcontroller but with little changes also for other flightcontrollers.  Be sure to include the mavlink library and set your arduino IDE for using the ESP8266 as board.  The ESP8266 runs the code.

This sketch gives additional  possibilities with your RC projects such as proportional or pre-set control of servos, switching on landing lights, ativiating buzzers, launching parachutes, reading sensors on your RC model as remote telemetry data,  etc.  How it works? The arduino sketch merely ""sniffs"" the SBUS data arriving on the serial port and split the package into 16 channels.  You are then able to  configure and map the Arduino pins to any available RC channel  as  you like. It\'s only limited to the number of channels and the number of free I/O ports on your Ardiuno.    The Arduino can be added \'in-line\' with any other SBUS device on your RC model. Please note that only limited testing has been done on using various RC cars and drones. so don\'t use this device for any critical or non-critical control of your model without thorough testing. You use the solution and code at your own risk. ","arduino,sensor,arduino-sbus,sbus,drone,uav,pwm,servos",8

The overall detection algorithm is supposed to run in real-time (several times a second) on the onboard micro-computer (Odroid XU4) of the drone and hence no neural networks were used in this project. The detection uses standard computer vision libraries like contour detection, color detection, Histogram of oriented gradient feature detection, and a support vector machine (SVM) on top of that to create a robust door detection. Additionally, the algorithm also calculates the distance of the door handle from the drone to guide the drone's autopilot in the right direction to approach the door.""}",,6
