RFID识别验证功能：在司机证件或者车内识别硬件嵌入RFID识别芯片，乘客使用手机读取到芯片信息，并且通过网络发送到出行平台数据库进行验证（我用JNI加了一个C语言的MD5加密算法对识别到的信息进行了加密）。如果不是合规的“人”或“车”，则不能完成订单并向平台或监管单位汇报当前位置。（为了方便读者测试，可以使用手机读取任何一个加密或非加密RFID芯片，比如银行卡、公交卡等，我在代码中的验证前阶段把芯片信息都换成我自己的司机信息，确保读者测试时可以收到服务器的回复） 2. 海外版功能：点击切换当前语言。 3. 司机证件号码识别功能：读取司机证件上的证件号码，也可以用来与出行平台数据库的接单司机信息进行。I complete this whole project on my own . Including Android application programming，web server ( Apache + PHP + MySQL),  and UI.  1．Map route planing。You can use mobile phone choose pick up & destination address，application provide address name hint and draw optimized route for user , then call car for you. 2．RFID authentication function：User can use application to scan driver license or other RFID hardware, then use NDK MD5 algorithm encrypt RFID number, and send it to Web Server Database, check with driver information and authenticate ID number , if ID number coherent with driver info , send back driver information to User and continue call car order . record user location  and alert if ID not coherent. 3．Driver License Number Recognition : Application can recognize driver license digit number ,and also can send to web server for authentication & feed back result to user.

The applications are developed using a component-oriented and event-driven API, eliminating the need to deal with the ""page-based"" nature of browsers. To the developer, Echo works just like a user interface toolkit.  The latest iteration, Echo3, features the ability to write applications in either server-side Java or client-side JavaScript. Server-side applications run in any Java Servlet Container and do not require developer knowledge of HTML, HTTP, or JavaScript. Client-side JavaScript-based applications do not require any server at all, but can of course communicate with one via XML or JSON over HTTP. Cross-platform AJAX technology is used for rendering, and no browser plugins are required.  Echo is open-source software, dual-licensed under the Mozilla Public License and LGPL.",,63

The annotated elements are then highlighted in a specific color. Annotation schemas can be defined by the user by creating a simple DTD representing the types and subtypes that must be highlighted.

After acquisition of series of images from the video, trucks are detected using Haar Cascade Classifier. The model for the classifier is trained using lots of positive and negative images to make an XML file. This is followed by tracking down the vehicles and estimating their speeds with the help of their respective locations, ppm (pixels per meter) and fps (frames per second). Now, the cropped images of the identified trucks are sent for License Plate detection. The CCA (Connected Component Analysis) assists in Number Plate detection and Characters Segmentation. The SVC model is trained using characters images (20X20) and to increase the accuracy, 4 cross fold validation (Machine Learning) is also done. This model aids in recognizing the segmented characters. After recognition, the calculated speed of the trucks is fed into an excel sheet along with their license plate numbers. These trucks are also assigned some IDs to generate a systematized database.","speed,number-plate,speed-estimation,vehicle-detection,vehicle-detection-and-tracking,license-plate-recognition,license-plate",40

RFID识别验证功能：在司机证件或者车内识别硬件嵌入RFID识别芯片，乘客使用手机读取到芯片信息，并且通过网络发送到出行平台数据库进行验证（我用JNI加了一个C语言的MD5加密算法对识别到的信息进行了加密）。如果不是合规的“人”或“车”，则不能完成订单并向平台或监管单位汇报当前位置。（为了方便读者测试，可以使用手机读取任何一个加密或非加密RFID芯片，比如银行卡、公交卡等，我在代码中的验证前阶段把芯片信息都换成我自己的司机信息，确保读者测试时可以收到服务器的回复） 2. 海外版功能：点击切换当前语言。 3. 司机证件号码识别功能：读取司机证件上的证件号码，也可以用来与出行平台数据库的接单司机信息进行。I complete this whole project on my own . Including Android application programming，web server ( Apache + PHP + MySQL),  and UI.  1．Map route planing。You can use mobile phone choose pick up & destination address，application provide address name hint and draw optimized route for user , then call car for you. 2．RFID authentication function：User can use application to scan driver license or other RFID hardware, then use NDK MD5 algorithm encrypt RFID number, and send it to Web Server Database, check with driver information and authenticate ID number , if ID number coherent with driver info , send back driver information to User and continue call car order . record user location  and alert if ID not coherent. 3．Driver License Number Recognition : Application can recognize driver license digit number ,and also can send to web server for authentication & feed back result to user.

WebAnnotator provides an easy and general-purpose framework and is made available under CeCILL free license (close to GNU GPL — see the license text), so that use and further contributions are made simple.  All parts of an HTML document can be annotated: text, images, videos, tables, menus, etc. The annotations are created by simply selecting a part of the document and clicking on the relevant type and subtypes. The annotated elements are then highlighted in a specific color. Annotation schemas can be defined by the user by creating a simple DTD representing the types and subtypes that must be highlighted. Finally, annotations can be saved (HTML with highlighted parts of documents) or exported (in a machine-readable format).",,44

After acquisition of series of images from the video, trucks are detected using Haar Cascade Classifier. The model for the classifier is trained using lots of positive and negative images to make an XML file. This is followed by tracking down the vehicles and estimating their speeds with the help of their respective locations, ppm (pixels per meter) and fps (frames per second). Now, the cropped images of the identified trucks are sent for License Plate detection. The CCA (Connected Component Analysis) assists in Number Plate detection and Characters Segmentation. The SVC model is trained using characters images (20X20) and to increase the accuracy, 4 cross fold validation (Machine Learning) is also done. This model aids in recognizing the segmented characters. After recognition, the calculated speed of the trucks is fed into an excel sheet along with their license plate numbers. These trucks are also assigned some IDs to generate a systematized database.","speed,number-plate,speed-estimation,vehicle-detection,vehicle-detection-and-tracking,license-plate-recognition,license-plate",40
